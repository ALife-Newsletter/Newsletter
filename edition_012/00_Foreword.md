**Artificial Life Newsletter 012 -- Fishes**

# A word from the team

Welcome to the 12th issue of the Alife Newsletter! In tandem with
ALIFE 2023, this is the first **Physical Edition** of the newsletter!
Keep it as a memento, or show it to your friends!

The theme for this issue is **fishes**. We have Fish fossil robots,
simulated fishes, and even some RL-powered sand to put in your aquarium.
Of course, you can also get some great seafood in Hokkaido.

Because of physical limitations, the texts in this edition are
shorter, and without animated gifs. But don't worry, you can still see
and extended version of the newsletter on the usual website (which you
can access using the QR code in the back).

As always, we appreciate any feedback and suggestions for future
content. If you are in ALIFE 2023, please come say hi to us! We'd be
very happy to hear your suggestions in person!
