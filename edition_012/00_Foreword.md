**Artificial Life Newsletter 012 -- Summer Beaches**

# A word from the team

Welcome to the 12th issue of the Alife Newsletter! In tandem with
ALIFE 2023, this is the first edition of the newsletter with a **Physical Edition** which you can find at the ALIFE2023 conference.
If you're at the conference and you pick up a copy, keep it as a memento, or show it to your friends!

The theme for this issue is **summer beaches!**. We have Fish fossil robots,
simulated fishes, sand beasts, and even some RL-powered sand to put in your aquarium.
Of course, you can also get some great seafood in Hokkaido.

We had to constrain how much information we could include in our physical edition, but not to worry: this digital edition---whether you have accessed it via the QR code, via your inbox, or are viewing it online---has no such constraints, and is full of incredible (longer-form) contributions.

As always, we appreciate any feedback and suggestions for future
content. If you are in ALIFE 2023, please come say hi to us! We'd be
very happy to hear your suggestions in person!
