# Making Robots from Swimming Fossils: Interview with Toshiyasu Kondo (Twitter: [@robokaseki](https://twitter.com/robokaseki))
* Interview by [Lana]()

A robot fish swims at the bottom of a shallow pool, its shape and color reminiscent of a horseshoe crab https://twitter.com/robokaseki/status/1672499885906726912?s=20.
Another one, shaped like a sunfish, zooms in bathtub. A third one bobs to the surface, its face slightly goofy looking.
But those are not inspired by horseshoe crabs, or sunfish. They are fossil fishes Bothriolepis bothriolepis, Ranzania ogaii, Sacabambaspis that Toshiyasu Kondo's robots are bringing back motion to.

Kondo's robots often help illuminating the kinetic characteristics of these fish, and he has published several papers in collaboration with paleontologists.
I asked him about his unconventional and inspirational path to the research world. (Interview edited for brevity)
