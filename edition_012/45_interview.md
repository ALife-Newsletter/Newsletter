# Making Robots from Swimming Fossils: Interview with Toshiyasu Kondo (Twitter: [@robokaseki](https://twitter.com/robokaseki))
* Interview by [Lana]()

A robot fish swims at the bottom of a shallow pool, its shape and color reminiscent of a horseshoe crab https://twitter.com/robokaseki/status/1672499885906726912?s=20.
Another one, shaped like a sunfish, zooms in bathtub. A third one bobs to the surface, its face slightly goofy looking.
But those are not inspired by horseshoe crabs, or sunfish. They are fossil fishes Bothriolepis bothriolepis, Ranzania ogaii, Sacabambaspis that Toshiyasu Kondo's robots are bringing back motion to.

Kondo's robots often help illuminating the kinetic characteristics of these fish, and he has published several papers in collaboration with paleontologists.
I asked him about his unconventional and inspirational path to the research world. (Interview edited for brevity)

**What motivates you?**

My daughter built an aquatic robot for her high school graduation project. She entered it at an underwater robots competition, and as a reward for here good work, I contacted the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and took her to see their experimental facility.

At that time I was already interested in aquatic robots myself, and occasionally helped as a volunteer during robot competitions. I started thinking that the students joining the competitions would benefit from educational resources about underwater robotics, especially the students creating biomimetic robots.

**Tell us more about that educational aspect of your project.**

Initially I was thinking mostly of contemporary species like sharks, focusing on observation in aquariums, study of the internal structure of prepared specimens, etc. But it turned out to be too time consuming and difficult for the students, so I pivoted to simpler swimming animal that could bring out the emotion of making one's own creation swim while being easy to build.
So I chose well preserved fossils, the ancestors of arthropods, who despite not having complex brains and not being very agile, were at the top of the food pyramid between the Ordovician and the Devonian period.

With the help of paleontologists and robotics engineers, after 2 years and many unexpected discoveries, I finished building a robot mimicking the motion of extinct sea scorpions and published my educational manual.

**Can your approach be used to understand life by building it, a tenet of ALife?**

After I released videos of my swimming sea scorpion and on social media and gave some lectures, it became easier to reach out to both professional and student paleontologists. I started supporting students who wanted to better understand the life of fossil animals by building robotic reproductions. The students went on to present their work at research conferences and science competitions, and thanks to their hard work it became possible for us to gather support and information from more and more researchers, including from outside Japan.


**What did your career path look like until now?**

In college I studied statistical psychology (specifically personality traits) and developed computer tools for psychology experiments. I then joined an electrical company and worked on the first educational tools on Laser Discs... I also worked on applications for Blu-ray. After leaving and becoming independent, I worked in marketing on social media and did some more development work for various platforms.


**Are there things that we can only understand by building, rather than by simulating organisms?**

It depends on what you want to understand about an organism. Their swarming behavior? Their interactions? The micro-currents at the interface between their skin and the water? In all of those cases, you are better off building a simulation.
On the other hand, the motion of real robots swimming in real water tends to be extremely different from simulated results, so if you base all of your estimations on simulated results you will never obtain a usable robot. Sometimes it is way faster and easier to just start by building the real thing. And to get inspiration for future projects, there is nothing like building, seeing, and feeling a real robot in your hands.
