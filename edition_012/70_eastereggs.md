# BONUS: Cover Image: Easter Eggs 

Did you manage to find all of the Artificial Life-related easter eggs in the cover image (created by our very own Gabe)? Here is the list of little references that he managed to sneak in:

- Conway's Game of Life Clouds (all 4 permutations of the glider are hidden within: did you find them all?)
- Karl Sims' Virtual Creatures
- Charles Darwin (reading the Artificial Life newsletter, of course...)
- The ALife Newsletter Mascot! (which might come to be known as "Allie" --- great suggestion by Lana!)

If you managed to get all of those references, then well done! Thank you, Gabe, for such a lovely and creative cover image for this very special edition of our newsletter.
