## Twelve Thought-Provoking Papers

On the 12th day of ALife Xmas, the newsletter gave to me: Twelve Thought-Provoking Papers! Here is a selection of ALife papers with a slightly philosophical edge that have (mostly) featured in the Artificial Life journal over the years. Whether you’re new to the community or if you’ve been involved for decades, we’re sure you’ll have plenty of chin-scratching moments by visiting or revisiting some of these articles.
