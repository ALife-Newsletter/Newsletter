## Five Amazing Artwork Collections

On the fifth day of ALife Xmas, the newsletter gave to me: Five amazing collections of artwork inspired by Artificial Life, for you to enjoy and feel inspired by. Sometimes they are a different way of looking at an existing concept, sometimes they are new things we can create with our existing tools. In the end, Life can be an inspiring thing, and so can Artificial Life!
