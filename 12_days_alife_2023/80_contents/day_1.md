## One Creative Community

On the first day of ALife Xmas, the newsletter gave to me: One creative community! The ALife community is several hundreds of researchers from various fields, all brought together by a fascination for the processes behind Life as we know it, and a desire to create Life as we donâ€™t yet know it. The ALife community is our first gift: join us, connect through [https://alife.org/](https://alife.org/) and subscribe to this very newsletter at [https://forms.gle/tXKTzx8SmKhD8j167](https://forms.gle/tXKTzx8SmKhD8j167) !
