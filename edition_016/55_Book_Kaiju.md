# Book Reviews: Imaginary Lifecycles
By [Mitsuyoshi](https://mitsuyoshi-yamazaki.github.io/)

In this section, I present books that feature creatures with imaginary lifecycles.

## “The dragon's final home” by Kotaro Tsunekawa

The dragons in this story are born as tiny tadpole-like creatures in the water and grow through metamorphosis. Only a handful of the thousands of juveniles survive to grow into the giant dragons that stand at the top of the ecosystem.
For dragons, the process of development is both a climb up the pyramid of the food chain and a broadening of horizons.
An aquatic creature that lived only in ponds becomes an amphibian, then a land-walking lizard, and finally a dragon that acquires wings and migrates from island to island.

As the (dragon) protagonist grows up, he sees that many of his own kind have ceased to continue their development and instead have chosen to live in the forms of fish, amphibians, or lizards. He learns that when their development stalls, their bodies stop growing, and at the same time, the extent of their behavior and status in the ecosystem becomes fixed.

When you cease your development, your status becomes fixed and you are looked down upon by your kin who have continued in their development... This is a metaphor for human growth in school and society, but the vivid depiction of it as the life cycle of a fictional creature, the dragon, is what draws us into this story.

## “Orthogonal” series by Gregg Egan

The Orthogonal trilogy depicts a world in which the laws of physics are slightly different from those of our world.
The name of the series, “Orthogonal”, refers to its orthogonal physics and the kind of world that such a system would produce. Within this alternate system, we are introduced to the ecology of the “humans” who appear in this world.

The “humans” of this world, like other creatures, procreate by an ancestor dividing its body to produce multiple descendents.
In other words, it is not possible for the mother to see her own children, as she instead splits her body and becomes them.
In creatures with such a lifecycle, the gender roles are biologically determined, with the female passing on the temporarily borrowed flesh of the mother to the next generation through the creation of offspring. Males raise their young.

This gender role can be derived from the simple observation that:
- A “mother” can procreate without a father.
- The species that allows children to be active from the moment of birth does not produce fathers.

The story describes how people with distinct gender roles live and how science is developed to free people from their natural gender roles.

## “Kaiju Preservation Society” by John Scalzi

In this story, there is a “monster” the size of a mountain!
There is only one energy source that can drive a creature of that size. A biological reactor.

Kaiju species live one of two lifecycles. The life cycle in which they do not obtain a reactor, and live their entire life as chemo-metabolizing titanotheres. The other is the lifecycle of a kaiju, in which the development of a nuclear reactor paves the way for its growth into a giant kaiju.

In addition to the interesting science fiction aspect of the ecology of a reasonable fictional life, it is also interesting to think about what kind of world setting could encompass such an ecology from the perspective of artificial life.
