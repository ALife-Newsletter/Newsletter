# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 16th issue of the Alife Newsletter! The theme for this newsletter is **Solarpunk**. Many of us have grown up on "Cyberpunk" -- an aesthetic that imagines the negative runaway effects of technology and capitalism on society. Now that, in true Torment Nexus style, many of those predictions are coming to tuition, a new aesthetic comes up to imagine how we can break into a future where nature, sustainable tech, and society can collaborate with each other. 

With this new image in mind, we bring a review of the science fiction books "Solarpunk Creatures", and "The Kaiju Preservation Society". We also highlight a link to the "Solarpunk Conference". 

Other news in this newsletter include the new discord servers for the Artificial Life community organized by the International Society of Artificial Life (ISAL); New episodes on Imy's podcast, "What ALife!"; a call for projects from the UKRI; and an online workshop of universal communication from Crosslabs. We also mourn the passing of Daniel Dennet, with an Eulogy from Dave Ackley.

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other Alifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!
