# Workshop Summary: The Quest for Universal Communication
By Claus, Lana

Last week [CrossLabs](https://www.crosslabs.org/) organized "After Babel: The Quest for Universal Communication". This was an online workshop to discuss the different aspects of communication in non-human entities, from aliens to animals to agents.

The workshop was held in a panel format, where first a number of panelists had an open-ended discussion about the proposed topic, followed by a session with questions from the audience. The topics were:

- Talking to Aliens and the Mathematics of Communication
- Animal, Cell and Non-Human Communication
- Private Language, Consciousness, Perceptions and Expanding our Senses
- Detecting Agents and Goal-Directedness
- Philosophy and Ethics of Diverse Intelligences

You can see a summary of the topics discussed, as well as Youtube links to each panel's recording at the "After Babel" [workshop webpage](https://www.crosslabs.org/after-babel-the-quest-for-universal-communication).
