# Rest In Peace, Daniel Dennett

[Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) was a philosopher who left a tremendous mark on several fields, including cognitive science and consciousness studies. Dennett passed away on April 19th. If you ever were interested in the hard science of consciousness, you probably heard of Dennett's models and experiments. What I did not know is that he also turned his sights to ALife.
Read below an homage to the philosopher by Dave Ackley. This text from [Dave's blog](https://livingcomputation.com/lc/morning/202404201125-dan-dennett.html) is shared with his permission.

## Thank you Dan

I loved Dan Dennett.  
Fuck that I love Dan still  
he's just dead.  

We overlapped at Tufts  
a 1970s undergrad me  

but we never met until  
a 1990s workshop at  
the Santa Fe Institute  

spinning alife models  
and riffing about what  
it all could mean.  

He became a mentor to me  
Wrote a letter for my tenure  
we became friends of a sort  
with only rare meetings and  
emails and precious calls  

Our last emails were in 2021  
"Carry on!" he wrote,  
his last words to me  
And I replied "My King!"  

Dave Ackley
