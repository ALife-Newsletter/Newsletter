# $100m UKRI Investment in Future AI Hubs
Written by Imy Khan(www.imytk.co.uk)

The UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) has invested almost $100 million USD into nine dedicated research hubs in the UK, focusing on tackling complex societal problems through what it calls "revolutionary and innovative AI".

While these buzzwords might make some of you roll your eyes, the scope of the research appears to be fairly broad and overlaps with many areas of research in the ALife community: complex systems, computational chemistry, closed-loop robotics, collective intelligence, just to name a few. 

In fact, our community's own Professor Seth Bullock will be leading one of these hubs from the University of Bristol, focusing on collective intelligence in application areas such as healthcare, pandemics, and the environment. 

For any researcher interested in these types of areas, this could be one to keep an eye on and follow closely. You can check out more details, including details of the hubs and their respective areas of interest, at the [UKRI's press release](https://www.ukri.org/news/100m-boost-in-ai-research-will-propel-transformative-innovations/).
