# Software Showcase & Call for Collaborators: Tölvera (Jack Armitage)
Edited by Imy Khan

Jack Armitage is a postdoctoral researcher at the [Intelligent Instruments Lab, Iceland](https://iil.is/): an interdisciplinary research lab that investigates the role of artificial intelligence in new musical instruments. 

Based on a desire for more diversity of real-time AI (and ALife) in music interaction, Jack developed a library called [Tölvera](https://intelligent-instruments-lab.github.io/tolvera/). Tölvera is a Python library designed for composing together and interacting with basal agencies, inspired by fields such as artificial life (ALife) and self-organising systems. It provides creative coding-style APIs that allow users to combine and compose various built-in behaviours, such as flocking, slime mold growth, and swarming, and also author their own.

Check out the relevant paper, "Tölvera: Composing With Basal Agencies" [here](http://iil.is/pdf/2024_nime_armitage_et_al_tolvera.pdf).

Call for Collaborators: I am looking for researchers from across ALife, biology and complex systems to collaborate with in using and extending the software project Tölvera.
I can be contacted at jack@hi.is or via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ER7tWds9vM)
