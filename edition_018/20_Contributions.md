TODO: Add pictures for the items below.

Several of our readers sent their projects to share through the newsletter. Take a look!

If you would like to talk about your project (even if it is still in progress), send us a message through the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89), send us a message through discord (we are all on the ISAL discord server), or send a message to our [Mastodon account](https://fediscience.org/@alifenewsletter)! 

We are always happy to highlight the work of our readers. Please add a short blurb (300 words or less) describing what you want to share. Pictures are specially welcome!

## "How to Train your Drone", a pictorial by Joseph La Delfa:

What if you wrote a paper in the shape of a picture book? That's what Joseph did with his paper published at DIS24, about the design and testing of a system called "how to train your drone", that grants users partial control over the shape of the drone's sensory apparatus. In doing so, bespoke control mappings and behaviour emerges.

You can [read it in the ACM digital library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660737) -- take a look, the paper is very pleasing to the eye! We need more creative designs to break away from the boring walls of text-and-equations.

The paper also draws some parallels between Alife and “research through design”. RtD is a family of design practices that focus more on emergence than problem solving. Joseph thinks there should be more bridges between the two communities. 

You can see [Joseph talk about the parallels between the two communities at the ERA workshop in this video!](https://youtu.be/OWNibNLjtdU) He also recommends a video documentary about research design called [Permission to much about](https://vimeo.com/961000450)

## HyperNEAT Substrate design tool, by b from the ISAL Discord Server (TODO)

b has been developing a tool for defining HyperNEAT substrates to help simplify the process. The tool is currently used by them for their own projects, but they are looking for people to check their work and provide feedback!

[You can check you the tool in b's website.](B: https://tkwn2080.github.io/substrate-designer) The basic idea is to allow the user to visually design semi-complex HyperNEAT substrates in a way that can easily interface with code. In particular, b is using this to construct spiking neural networks.

## METTA-AI, by David Bloomin (TODO)

[Metta AI](https://github.com/Metta-AI/metta)
A reinforcement learning codebase focusing on the emergence of cooperation and alignment in multi-agent AI systems.
