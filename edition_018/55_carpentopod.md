# The Carpentopod
Shared by Lana

Have you seen [the viral videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKDY4yWxfJM) of this walking coffe table?

Giliam de Carpentier designed this table by using genetic algorithms to select the best linkages for the table legs. For those familiar with Theo Jansen's strandbeests, the carpentopod's linkages are actually more compact and allow for a more robust walking gait.
Evolution, often one step ahead of human design... 

Find all the details of Giliam's thought process and experiments on [his blog](https://www.decarpentier.nl/carpentopod).

Thank you Giliam for giving us permission to share your pictures and videos!
