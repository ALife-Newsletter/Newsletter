# Game of Life on a Klein Bottle

You have probably seen the Game of Life play on a 2D square with periodic boundaries -- what exits on the right side comes back through the left side, and what goes out from the top comes back from the bottom...
The equivalent of wrapping the flat surface onto a donut.

But have you ever seen the Game of Life play on a Klein surface, where there is no front or back? [Now you can](https://bsky.app/profile/jbertolotti.bsky.social/post/3l4g6tcgw322n), thanks to Jacopo Bertolotti.
