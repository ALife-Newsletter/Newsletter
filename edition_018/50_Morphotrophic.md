# Book Review: Morphotrophic, by Greg Egan (2024)
Shared by Lana Sinapayen

What if we couldn't take multicellularity for granted, and every cell had the potential to revert to unicellularity it it felt like it?
What if these unicellular entities could be convinced to get back to communal life, and integrate another body plan?
Many of Greg Egan's are very popular in the ALife community, but this one is special: it was inspired by the work of the team behind the Xenobots project, work that received the 2021 Award for Outstanding Publication from the International Society for Artificial Life! 

I couldn't put the book down. Beyond the raw interest of the scientific concepts, the social and philosophical implications are so well integrated in the world building that you'll find yourself empathising with many of the characters even if when you don't agree with their motivations.
A must-read.
