# ALife 2024 Retrospective

By [Gabriel J Severino](https://sites.google.com/view/gabrieljulianoseverino/home)

I feel as though the 2024 conference theme, “Exploring New Frontiers,” couldn’t have come at a better time. For over 30 years, the ALife community has embraced a spirit of exploration, often prioritizing discovery and innovation over immediate practical application. This is what makes the field so fascinating—there’s a real excitement in the unknown. The trade-off between exploring new ideas and exploiting established ones is a challenge every scientific field faces, and ALife has clearly hit the ‘explore’ button with vigor.

The theme felt particularly resonant this year because it touches on a broader question: what does it mean to explore new frontiers in science today? In the age of AI and computational advances, exploration often feels synonymous with pushing technological boundaries, but in ALife, it also means embracing creative, interdisciplinary approaches to understanding life itself. The sheer diversity of ideas and approaches showcased at ALife 2024 was a testament to this mindset. From evolutionary robotics to synthetic biology, from digital organisms to emergent social behaviors, the conference truly reflected breadth of research ecompasses by ALife.

As the conference theme suggests, this is also a good time to reflect on what a “fundamental science of artificial life” might look like. The field has long been about understanding the principles of life and intelligence, but the boundaries of ALife remain somewhat fluid, which can be both a strength and a limitation. This flexibility allows ALife to engage with broad interdisciplinary methodologies, integrating several different discplines, such as computational modeling, experimental biology, and robotics. However, the absense of a clearly defined set of theoretical foundations can make it difficult to identify exactly what scientific questions ALife, as a discipline, is uniquely positioned to answer. Other fields, such as mathematical biology or cognitive science, also grapple with questions about life and intelligence. What makes ALife distinct?

These questions of identity and purpose seemed to continually reemerge in conversations with a variety of different researchers (both from within ALife and from those visiting from other fields) throughout the week, reflecting a tension between exploration and exploitation—the same tension faced by any field navigating the fine line between speculative, fundamental research and more applied, outcome-driven work. In ALife, the spirit of exploration is very much alive. But there’s also an emerging recognition of the importance of balancing this exploration with clearer scientific foundations. This balance is crucial for the continued development of the field, as it provides the grounding necessary for sustained progress while maintaining the sense of intellectual curiosity that makes ALife so unique.

What truly stood out to me, however, was the sense of community and collaboration that permeated the event—particularly among early-career researchers. The [Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA)](https://sites.google.com/view/emergingresearchersinal) events were a huge success, providing a great oppurtunity for newer members of the ALife community to connect, share their work, and build collaborations. These events not only helped break down barriers but also fostered a genunie connection between people excited about the same niche things. ERA events, such as the "coffee" roundtable (which was really just a little party) and the always-entertaining Academic Karaoke night, allowed folks to really connect with each other in a fun, relaxed environment.

Personally, while the intellectual stimulation and inspiration were immense, the most rewarding part of the conference was the opportunity to meet and connect with so many awesome and brilliant people.
