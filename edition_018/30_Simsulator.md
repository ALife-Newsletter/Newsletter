# Software Review: The Simsulator (Michael Finn)
Shared by [Imy Khan](http://twitter.com/imy_tk)

Making ALife more accessible to the masses is one of the coolest things our community can do.

Michael Finn has reintroduced Sims' famous [Evolved Virtual Creatures](https://karlsims.com/evolved-virtual-creatures.html) into the world: this time, no coding required! The Simsulator is an open-source platform for simulating Sims' Evolved Virtual Creatures, providing tools to evolve, breed, experiment on the virtual creatures. This is a really great piece of software for those who haven't yet had a chance to be hands-on with EVC and want an intuitive way to play with (and study) them. It's also a really great educational tool, providing a really accessible, intuitive way to explore artificial life and evolutionary computation.

This software was also demonstrated at ALIFE 2024, and you can read the corresponding paper [here](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2024/36/84/123510). The Simsulator works across all platforms, is packed full of interesting sandbox features, and (from what I hear) has a VR version in the works!
