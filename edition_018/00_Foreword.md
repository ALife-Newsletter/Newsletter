# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 18th issue of the Alife Newsletter! The theme for this newsletter is 

**TODO**: Newsletter Theme

**TODO**: Short blurb about other contributions

We hope that you have enjoyed the ALIFE 2024 conference in July. If you couldn't be there, don't worry! Gabriel has written a retrospective for this edition of the newsletter. Also, you can now read the [online version of edition 17](https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/edition_017.html), that was available physically during the conference.

In this edition, we are happy to share several contributions from our readings about the projects that they have been working on, including a tool for HyperNEAT, a multi-agent library, and even a picture book version of a paper!

Also in this edition, Lana review's Greg Egan's newest book, which is based on an ALIFE project! She also shares a fascinating project where a mushroom is used as a robot's brain!

Finally, we would like to highlight our side project [Alife Socials](https://github.com/ALife-Newsletter/alife_social). This is a list of the different social media used by alifers (Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, and even good old blogs!) Make sure to add yours too.

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other Alifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Gabriel
