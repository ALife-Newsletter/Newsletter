LIST OF ADVENT LINKS

This file is a place for each member of the team to list three 
items they want to offer for the "homecoming" advent. 

Each item should be a link and a "short" description of what the
link contains (LANA: How short?)

I would recommend that, for each of us, each link should be 
of a different type than the other two links (eg.: one media, one 
paper, one something else).


ITEMS:

- Claus 
1) "Batteries Not Included"
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092494

This 1987 movie may not be a masterpiece, but it left a deep impression 
in me when I was a child that life could come in many forms. A sweet movie
about a group of neighbors being visited by very different life forms, 
something for you to watch with the kids this Christmas!

2) "Learning and Coevolving Robots in Competitive Multi-Agent Environments"
https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2025/37/76/134085

This is one of my favorite papers from 2025 ALIFE in Kyoto. It is the Evogym
soft robot environment that we all know and love, but the authors made it
so that two robots would evolve/compete at the same time. One interesting 
twist is when one of the robots is replaced by an equivalent "dummy" in the 
training. An easy and fun read.

3) "The RSS Board"
https://www.rssboard.org/

The RSS board is an entity to promote the use of "Real Simple Sindication",
a 20 year old technology that solves a problem that is extremely relevant
today: How to share information on the web without bloat, walled gardens,
and tracking. I'm a huge fan of RSS, and I would love to see more ALIFERs
using this protocol to share their professional, and personal news!
