# The 2025 Artificial Life Advent

Do you know of Christmas Advent Calendars? This is a Western tradition where a calendar containing one box for each day of December is prepared. Each day you open one of the boxes, and an eticing surprise is waiting for you: A treat, a message, an image.

With this spirit in mind, we prepared our own ALIFE advent calendar for you. Every day from today until New Years Eve, you can click the link below to find a new intersting ALIFE tidbit, brought to you by the ALIFE Newsletter Editors:
