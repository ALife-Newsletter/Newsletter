# The 2025 Artificial Life Advent

Do you know of Christmas Advent Calendars? This is a Western tradition where a calendar is prepared with one box for each day of December. Every day, when you open one of the boxes, an enticing surprise is waiting for you: A treat, a message, an image.

With this spirit in mind, we have prepared our own ALIFE advent calendar for you. Every day from today until New Years Eve, you can click the link below to find a new interesting ALIFE tidbit, brought to you by the ALIFE Newsletter Editors:
