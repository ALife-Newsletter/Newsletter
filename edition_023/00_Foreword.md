# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 23rd issue of the ALife Newsletter! We have come to the end of another year, and we hope that 2025 was a good year for you! Accordingly, we dedicate this edition to reflecting on the past, and preparing for the coming year. 

So first, we bring to you the results and impressions from the **Community Survey** we've done earlier this year. What kind of answers did we get from the community? What did we learn? And how do we plan to move forward?

We have also prepared the second **ALIFE Advent Calendar**. Do you remember the first one in 2023? The theme for the advent calendar this year is **Homecoming**. From each newsletter editor, we bring three items that connects us to our roots as scientists, as ALifers, and as people. I hope this will be interesting and bring some nice reflections to you too!
