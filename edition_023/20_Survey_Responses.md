# The ALIFE Community Survey: Reflections
*By Claus and Martha*

Thank all of you who contributed to our survey. Your answers gave us a better idea of who is reading the Newsletter, what you like about our work, and how we could improve moving forward.

There are many lessons that we can take from your answers to the surveys. Below we write up things that came to our minds as we read up your answers.

First, one of our main goals with this survey was to learn what you enjoyed about the Newsletter, so that we can do more of that. Summing up the different comments that we received, there was an overall theme of "Paper, People and Projects" as things that the readers most liked. 

We have a list of interesting papers that we find, so you can be sure that there will be more featured papers on the newsletter. The "People" part is interesting -- we used to make interviews, but they turned out to be very work intensive, and we shifted focus to other things. But knowing that this was a favorite part of the newsletter gives us motivation to think of how add interviews again, hopefully without adding too much workload to the editorial team. That includes interviews with individuals, and also features on working groups and laboratories.

(On the other hand, very few people mentioned "book reviews" as one of the thing they liked in the newsletter, which was... interesting ^^;)

Another common suggestion was the improvement of the Newsletter design. We will certainly look into reviewing our lovingly hand-crafted CSS, but if anyone among the readership has web-design experience, please do contact us!

On a similar topic, some comments that stood up to us were about how the difference of voices in each edition/topics was a positive point. We are always happy to feature the suggestions of the readers regarding topics to cover, but we also feel that there is a lot of friction for people to leave their recommendations. We would love to know if you could tell us what makes it difficult for you to offer suggestions of things to feature in the newsletter.

Although the Survey is over, we are always interested in hearing the opinions of our readers. Please do feel free to reach to us through social media or our feedback form with more comments and ideas about what you want to read in the Artificial Life Newsletter!
