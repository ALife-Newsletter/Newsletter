# Spore

For those who aren’t familiar, [Spore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game)) is a PC game (from 2008) that attempts to simulate the entire arc of life: starting as a microscopic organism in a tide pool and "evolving" through social tribes, cities, and eventually interstellar travel. I remember buying Spore on a whim from a game store when I was a teenager. At the time, I had absolutely no idea what "Artificial Life" even was - I just enjoyed playing video games and I was captivated by the cover artwork. After taking it home and installing it, I played it for a few weeks, but never really got into it. Or, maybe I just didn't really appreciate it. Maybe 2008-Imy wasn't ready for it. In hindsight, I realise that I had been sitting on a massive ALife sandbox!

My memories of the game are a bit fragmented, but I do remember watching my creatures mutate and evolve into strange entities, and all the while thinking, "how does the game do that?!" So maybe I should give this game another chance. A quick Google tells me it's on the Steam store, so I know what I'm doing over Christmas...!
