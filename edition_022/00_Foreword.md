# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 22nd issue of the ALife Newsletter! This edition was a **Physical Print Edition** which was distributed to participants of the International Conference in Articificial Life, 2025, in Kyoto.

Some of the content for this edition might not translate very well to a digital edition, but we did the best to adapt what could be adapted! In particular, because of space restrictions of the print media, the newsletter may look quite short digitally. But you do get to click links instead of scanning QR codes, so there are some upsides too!

Without further ado, we give you:

# Artificial Life Newsletter, 3rd Print Edition

They say *"twice is a coincidence, three times is a pattern"*, so with this edition, we can say now it is a **tradition** to prepare print editions of the Artificial Life Newsletter to go with the Annual International Conference on Artificial Life!
