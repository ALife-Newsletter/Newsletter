# ALife Community Podcast: Call for Questions

We are happy to announce that we will be recording the first episode of the ALife Community Podcast in May. Our first guest is due to be the current president of the ISAL board, Dr. Charles Ofria. We are looking for questions from the community to put forth to Dr. Ofria. If there is anything you would like to ask him, please email imytkhan@gmail.com with the subject "ALife Podcast Questions", or send a DM on Twitter to @imy_tk.
