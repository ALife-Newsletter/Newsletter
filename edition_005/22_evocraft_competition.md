# Competition Highlight: Evocraft
*Contributed by [Elias Najarro](https://twitter.com/enasmel)*

The purpose of this contest on open-endedness is to highlight the progress in algorithms that can create novel and increasingly complex artefacts. While most experiments in open-ended evolution have so far focused on simple toy domains, we believe Minecraft -with its almost unlimited possibilities- is the [perfect environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04751) to study and compare such approaches. While other popular Minecraft competitions, like MineRL, have an agent-centric focus, in this competition the goal is to directly evolve Minecraft builds.

To facilitate the development of submissions, we provide the [EvoCraft API](https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py): a python interface to Minecraft. EvoCraft is implemented as a mod for Minecraft that allows clients to manipulate blocks in a running Minecraft server programmatically through an API. The framework is specifically developed to facilitate experiments in artificial evolution. The competition framework also supports the recently added "redstone" circuit components in Minecraft, which allowed players to build amazing functional structures, such as bridge builders, battle robots, or even complete CPUs. Can an open-ended algorithm running in Minecraft discover similarly complex artefacts automatically? If you have an API feature that you would like to use that is currently missing, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py).

If you want to get familiar with the notion of open-ended algorithms, this is a good starting point: [Open-endedness: The last grand challenge youâ€™ve never heard of](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/open-endedness-the-last-grand-challenge-youve-never-heard-of/).
