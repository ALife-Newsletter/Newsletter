Hello ISAL Members! Weâ€™ve just wrapped up a successful ALIFE 2022 and the ISAL board would like to get some feedback from you all on two specific aspects of conference organization, double-blind reviewing and extended abstracts, as well as any other comments or suggestions that you have.
Please complete the survey at the following link by September 6th: https://forms.gle/sfhdu1xfJPRptsbo7
