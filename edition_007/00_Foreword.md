# A word from the team

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

Welcome to the 7th issue of the ALife Newsletter. Last month we had the yearly meeting of the [International Society of Artificial Life (Alife 2022)](https://www.2022.alife.org/), which we hope was as inspiring for everyone as it was for our team.

We are terribly grateful and humbled by receiving the **ISAL Exceptional Service Award**. We would like to thank everyone who has made contributions to these Seven Editions, and everyone who has taken the time to read our collection of Artificial Life news and interesting projects. We hope to continue serving as a platform to amplify the voices of our community, and raise awareness of cool and inspiring projects to everyone.

Speaking about cool and inspiring projects, this edition has some great content ... (**TODO** write about all the great content).

The Newsletter is distributed by email, and archived on the International Society for Artificial Life's website.

If you'd like to receive our e-mails, you can subscribe [here](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89).

Also, we encourage everyone to contribute to the next newsletter [here](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9) (ETA October 2022)! In particular, we are specially interested in Master and PhD students who want to talk about their own research ideas. Do send us a line!

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Katt.
