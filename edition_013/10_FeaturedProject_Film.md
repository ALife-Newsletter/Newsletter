After the extinction of humanity, a machine relives the life of its programmer and all of its ancestors. Within seconds, it has primitive dreams of an exuberant pilgrimage for which hardly any ruins remain.

How to teach a computer what is sacred?

The history of each one of us is the history of all our previous lives, each of us was first a cell and as we grow we relive the path of our ancestors. This fragile body that I am, is in itself my own history. Otherwise inaccessible but through my own existence.

But the nature of history is destruction, the world is destroyed by those who build it, and the very ones who remember also forget.
To be born is in itself to forget what has already been lived, to re-member.

The computer contains a duality, It is finite and also contains everything, Code and video look at each other like a mirror.
The image is a never ending newly created memory.
