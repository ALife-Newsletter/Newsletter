**Artificial Life Newsletter 013 -- THEME TO BE SELECTED**

# A word from the team

Welcome to the 13th issue of the Alife Newsletter! We are back to our traditional online editions, and this time we got a nice selection of interesting Alife-y projects for you to check out!

The theme for this issue is **TODO** - talk about the different contributions.

As always, we appreciate any feedback and suggestions for future content. Please don't hesitate to reach us by e-mail, social media, or our trusty submission form! If you got something to share that other Alifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Gabriel
