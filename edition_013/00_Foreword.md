# A word from the team

Welcome to the 13th issue of the Alife Newsletter! We are back to our traditional online editions, and this time we got a nice selection of interesting Alife-y projects for you to check out!

The theme for this issue is **Emergence**. Emergence is a critical characteristic of Alife systems: the whole is bigger than the sum of parts. In the same way, your contributions interact with the brains of the readers in unexpected ways, creating new ideas and possibly new discoveries!

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other Alifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Gabriel
