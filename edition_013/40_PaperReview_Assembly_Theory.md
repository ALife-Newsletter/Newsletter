# Paper Review -- Assembly Theory
Shared by Lana

Did you hear about Assembly Theory? It's not much of an exageration to say that these two words have been all over ALife news in the last year or so.

The theory received the ISAL Award for Outstanding Publication of 2022 at this year's ALife conference in Sapporo.

It was also picked up by popular science media and conveniently summarized for a general audience, so if you found it complicated to go through the papers, I strongly recommend having a look at this [Quanta Magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-theory-for-the-assembly-of-life-in-the-universe-20230504/) or even at the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_theory)!

In a word, Assembly Theory orders chemical molecules by complexity, where the complexity depends (more or less) on the time such molecules would need to be formed from simpler molecules. Assembly Theory was proposed as a way to characterize molecules that are created by living organisms: very complex molecules need more steps and more time to be created, so the probability that they would emerge without a living system to produce them is lower than that of simpler molecules.

Assembly Theory could therefore potentially be used to detect life in environments where we are not certain life exists, most notably planets outside the solar system.
