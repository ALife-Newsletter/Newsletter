# Book Review: "The Road Not Taken"
By [Claus Aranha](https://scholar.social/@caranha)

It is fun to imagine alternate history about technologies. 
What would happen if a modern technology was available to 
ancient people, or if a society did not develop a technology 
that we consider essential today?

"The Road Not Taken", by Harry Turtledove, is a short science
fiction story where humanity meets a race of aliens 
that followed a very different technological history than 
ourselves. From the point of view of Alife, the story 
raises questions of what happens when a society finds itself 
stuck in a cultural local optima.
 
The magazine where the story was originally published, back 
in 1985, may be hard to find nowadays. It is definitely worth 
it trying to track down this story on the internet, though!
