# Another Simulation Youtube Channel: 8 Little Bears
By Claus

In recent years, several youtube channels featuring evolution simulators 
have sprung into existence. They are great, and we hope to feature more of 
them here (send us your favorite!).

You might remember "The Bibites", featured in the [4th edition of the newsletter](https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/edition_004.html), with virtual individuals with a quite detailed internal biology.

This time we want to feature ["8 little bears"](https://www.youtube.com/@EightLittleBears), a channel which also describes an evolution simulation using the Unity engine. This time, the simulator focuses in the environment and the ecological relations between the creatures, such as predation, competition, grouping and migration. 

In this simulation, each cell has different temperature, rainfall, and amount of biological matter, affecting the ability of the cell to support the virtual creatures. This in turn leads to interesting emergent ecological relations such as overpopulation, competition, migration, etc.

Each video lasts between 10-20 minutes, and features some small change to the creatures or the environment of the simulation, such as new diets, or a bigger map. The authors has a great eye to the visual site, with cute graphics for the creatures and environment that makes the simulation come alive, and fun to watch.

I hope you enjoy them, and again, [let us know if you have a suggestion of a nice channel with alife-y content](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9)!
