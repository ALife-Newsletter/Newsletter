# 8 little bears youtube Channel
By Claus

TODO

In recent years, there have been many youtube channels about evolution 
simulators.

In the path, we featured the bibites, this time we feature 8 little 
bears. While the bibites focused on a detailed simulation of the 
internal organs and minds of the virtual creatures, this channel focuses 
more in the environment and ecology, which is a subject that interests 
me greatly!

This channel also features an digital evolution simulator created in 
unity. However, this time the simulation focuses in the environment, as 
each cell in the simulation has different temperature, rainfall, and 
also biological matter left by dead creatures, which feeds plants.

Each video has 10-20 minutes, and it is interesting to observe 
the addition of new features from video to video, such as different 
kinds of diets, and different predation strategies. 

Finally, the author of the videos has a great eye to the graphical part 
as well -- the virtual creatures are represented by simple but 
expressive sprites that make the entire simulation come alive.
