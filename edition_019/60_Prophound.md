# Career Development Hints for Emerging Researchers
*Shared by Andrew Cusick, ProPhounD Co-Founder, and Jevin Lortie, PhD*

ProPhounD and the Emerging Researchers Association (ERA) recently 
hosted a career development event for organizations hiring talent 
with advanced degrees and professionals that are a match for those 
roles. To respond to the call from attendees seeking guidance on 
how to find a purpose-driven career, Andrew Cusick, ProPhounD 
Co-Founder and Jevin Lortie, PhD, compiled a road map from PhDs 
who’ve pursued alternate career paths with their advanced degrees 
to help you “get unstuck”.

[More details about this road map, and ideas about the many possible 
paths for a PhD can be read at ProPhound's full blog post](https://www.pro-phound.com/blog/gettingunstuck)
