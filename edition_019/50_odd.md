# Odd: bizarre plant forms
Shared by Lana

["Odd"](https://vimeo.com/1018644295?share=copy) is a beautiful, psychedelic exploration of artificial plant forms by artist Hiroshi Takagishi. From the video description:

"Odd is inspired by the contradictions of bizarre plant forms that reveal hidden reularities and beauty withn seemingly chaotic nature. The unique curves and protrusions of the bizarre plants suggest potential movement. I imagines the moment when this stationary plant is in motion and recreates it as media art."
