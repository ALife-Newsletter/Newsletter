# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 19th issue of the Alife Newsletter! The theme for the newslettert is "Together", thinking about the holidays seasons that are fast approaching.

If you get together with your friends over the New Year's break, how about showing them some alife-y news from this newsletter, as a conversation starter?

This time we are recommending a youtube channel about cute (and sometime scary) bears that evolve, and also an interactive slime mold simulation for those feeling more adventurous. Or maybe you would appreciate a psychedelic video about artificial plants?

On a more academic side, we bring a call for a special issue on Artificial Life in the Nature Portfolio Journal (NPJ series), and a review of the recent Low Carbon Computing Workshop. Also don't forget to prepare yourself for ALIFE 2025, in Kyoto this year.

And if you are feeling lost, we bring a message from a company that is reaching out to young alifer's researchers to help them figure out possible career paths after they acquire their PhDs.

If you are Japanese or a Japanese speaker, you might be interested in the [Japanese Version of the Alife Newsletter](https://sites.google.com/view/alifenewsletterjapan/home), recently released by ALIFE researchers in Japan with the goal of strenghtening the community over there!

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [contribution form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other Alifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!
