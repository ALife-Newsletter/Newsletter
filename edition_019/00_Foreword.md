# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 19th issue of the Alife Newsletter! 
SOMETHING ABOUT THE "TOGETHER" THEME.

MESSAGE SUMMARIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS.

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [contribution form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other Alifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Gabriel
