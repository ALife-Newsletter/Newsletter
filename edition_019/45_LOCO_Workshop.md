# Low Carbon Computing 2024 Workshop
*By Claus*

With the growing cost of computing in ICT and Machine Learning, and concerns about climate change and sustainability, some researchers have started to look at how to develop alternate computing systems, including new devices, programming languages, and computational processes, that have a smaller impact on our environment.

In this context, the [1st International Workshop on Low Carbon Computing (LOCO)](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/loco/loco2024/) was held early in December, gathering people with all sorts of interesting ideas about how to measure and reduce the environmental impact of computing. The abstracts and short papers presented at the workshop are now available online, and soon the videos of the presentations will be as well.

For me as an ALIFE researcher, there is something about low carbon and permacomputing that goes beyond the (very important) concerns about sustainability and environmental impact.

The evolution of life on earth was a process that took hundreds of millions of years. Even though it was a world spanning process, it took many false starts and a long process for life to evolve from the "primordial soup" to the diversity of species that we have today. How can we expect our computational process to be any different?

Although we are not there yet (?), I do believe that eventually we will want to create digital evolution simulations, or even robots, that will run for decades, if not more. This goes against the trend of our technological landscape, where the lifetime of each generation of digital devices seems shorter than the last. 

I invite the Alife community to consider computing platforms that can robustly work for years, independently from changes around itself and without putting undue burden on the environment.
