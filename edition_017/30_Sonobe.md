# Sonobe, Modular Origami

Sonobe is an Origami fold that can be joined with other copies of itself to make complex shapes. The physical edition in ALIFE 2024 included an origami paper piece that you could fold and join with the pieces folded by other alifers. But you can still create your own modular origami following the links below!
