# A word from the team

Welcome to the 12th issue of the Alife Newsletter! In tandem with
ALIFE 2023, this is the first edition of the newsletter with a **Physical Edition** which you can find at the ALIFE2023 conference.
If you were at the conference and picked up a copy, keep it as a memento, or show it to your friends!

The theme for this issue is **summer beaches!**. We have Fish fossil robots, simulated fishes, sand beasts, and even some RL-powered sand to put in your aquarium. Of course, you can also get some great seafood in Hokkaido.

We had to constrain how much information we could include in our physical edition, but not to worry: this digital edition---whether you have accessed it via the QR code, via your inbox, or are viewing it online---has no such constraints, and is full of incredible (longer-form) contributions.

As always, we appreciate any feedback and suggestions for future
content. If you were in ALIFE 2023, we'd be
very happy to hear your impressions about the conference!


Welcome to the 17th issue of the Artificial Life Newsletter. Like last year, this edition was a physical edition, in tandem with ALIFE 2024, in Denmark. Due to *life* (not the artificial kind), the digital version was delayed this time, and we apologize for that! As a manner of apology, we'll try to add some little online updates for each of the collaborations below (and maybe some extra text that could not make into the digital format due to space constraints).

The theme for the 17th issue is **connections** -- the yearly conference is the perfect opportunity to connect with new people, ideas and opportunities. With this in mind, we offer you a live list of ALifers social media (that you can join!), a modular origami that you can assemble with others in the conference, and the team's favorite ALife-y books, papers and entertainment for your lunch break or the long way back home. 

**Don't forget to subscribe!** You can follow us by RSS, or by adding your e-mail to [this form](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89).
