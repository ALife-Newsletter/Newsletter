# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 17th issue of the Artificial Life Newsletter. Like last year, this edition was a physical edition, in tandem with ALIFE 2024, in Denmark. Due to *life* (not the artificial kind), the digital version was delayed this time, and we apologize for that! As a manner of apology, we'll try to add some little online updates for each of the collaborations below (and maybe some extra text that could not make into the digital format due to space constraints).

The theme for the 17th issue is **connections** -- the yearly conference is the perfect opportunity to connect with new people, ideas and opportunities. With this in mind, we offer you a live list of ALifers social media (that you can join!), a modular origami that you can assemble with others in the conference, and the team's favorite ALife-y books, papers and entertainment for your lunch break or the long way back home. 

**Don't forget to subscribe!** You can follow us by RSS, or by adding your e-mail to [this form](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89).
