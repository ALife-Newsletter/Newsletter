# Alife Social Directory

Do you want to connect to new ALifers and find out what they're up to?

We have created an online [*ALife Social Directory*](https://github.com/ALife-Newsletter/alife_social) that gathers links to the social media accounts of members of the community. It includes Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter and many others.

You can add your own socials to the directory by [filling this form](https://forms.gle/GZfgE5Am3mPwo64MA), or sending a pull request to the Directory repository!

*Post-Conference Update:* A lot of people have added their socials, and sent code updates to make the directory prettier and easier to understand! Even if you did look at it during the conference, it is a great time to check it out again!
