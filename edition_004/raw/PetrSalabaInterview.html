Who you are, where you&rsquo;re from, what your area is, etc?</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">My initial background in theatre and reportage photography. You can find photos of burning cars in the streets of Vancouver and nightlife parties in my portfolio. This has further synthesized into documentary filmmaking with the focus on communication of science. I&rsquo;m currently finishing my masters at the Film and TV Faculty of the Performing Arts in Prague in the Department of Documentary Film. Besides filmmaking, I work part time at the Czech Technical University where I help to set up and coordinate interdisciplinary projects - for example a collaboration with the Czech National Institute Mental Health about machine learning analysis of sleep patterns for predicting affective mood changes in subliclinal population. </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On &ldquo;ALife&rdquo;</span></p><ol class="c1 lst-kix_lxu5bkjpgwg9-0" start="2"><li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Why is your research Alife-like?</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c4 c9"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">As an artist, I&rsquo;m preparing a documentary film about the general concept of emergence. And as a science networker who dips into interesting topics across areas, I&rsquo;m drawn into the theory of embodied cognition. The two areas that I&rsquo;m currently exploring are about dance archeology and AAI. By dance archeology I mean the reconstruction and reinterpretation of the baroque dances that were recorded in symbolic Beauchamp-Feuillet notation. These baroque dances originated at the court of the king Louis XIV and are particularly interesting for the ritualistic and propagandistic effect they had. It is believed that Louis XIV managed to unprecedentedly consolidate power and gain authority through his grandeur ballet performances. I find this as a great example of epistemic significance of embodied cognition where we can observe cognition as a relation between mind, body, space and goal oriented action unfolding in real time. So I&rsquo;m figuring out how to connect the research from the Laboratory of Chronorobotics at CTU with the analysis of the baroque dance patterns of the ballet dancers from the dance academy.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">And AAI stands for animal assisted intervention. I think many people are excited about artificial intelligence because it offers some comparative perspective to our human cognition. But then I find that most of AI research provides a very isolationist perspective on cognition. So ethology in the context of animal assisted psychotherapy and emotional human-animal interaction seems to me as a very low hanging fruit for further research in comparative cognition. More than any formal research, this is a passion that I&rsquo;m currently exploring as I&rsquo;m learning how to ride a horse. </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><ol class="c1 lst-kix_lxu5bkjpgwg9-0" start="3"><li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Why do you do ALife research (especially if you have another main research field)?</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>I like the Alife approach to cognitive sciences because it is very bottom-up. And not only that it might make sense to go the Alife way in order to develop more advanced artificial intelligence, I think it&rsquo;s also the way to even start communicating about cognition. This is useful for me when I&rsquo;m thinking about how to talk about artificial intelligence or cognition in my art work. Most art and culture is drawn so much to artificial intelligence as some meaningful &ldquo;other&rdquo; that we can compare ourselves to. But I think that&rsquo;s often intellectually very dishonest. To me it makes more sense to first explore general principles such as emergence or reinforcement feedback loops before we get speculating about human-like behaviour.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><ol class="c1 lst-kix_lxu5bkjpgwg9-0" start="4"><li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">What is your vision for the future of ALife research?</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">As I foreshadowed earlier I think it&rsquo;s about the horses. Really. Equine neuroscience is still a very emerging field, yet through our mutual embodied cognition we have managed to gain a lot of utility from these animals for about 8 000 years. I think that the further study of equine cognition could enlighten us in the general principles of how the entire nervous system of an organism functions. We should focus more towards the perspective on cognition that takes into account all the sensory input from the environment and emotional regulation in the limbic system before the final evaluation in the neocortex.</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Research</span></p><ol class="c1 lst-kix_lxu5bkjpgwg9-0" start="5"><li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">What convinced you to become a researcher?</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>As a filmmaker believing in effective altruism, I&rsquo;ve been wondering what topics would make the most beneficial impact if I captured them in my </span><span>film</span><span>s. And so communication of science seemed to me as a potentially impactful path and lots of fun. As I was making research for the development of my films, I realized that if I want to say something meaningful and intellectually honest, I should put a substantial effort into the research phase. This is far from usual in the filmmaking art world as there is rarely any budget for too much prior thinking. And so as I was meeting scientists across the fields, I was gaining horizontal understanding in different areas and I eventually drifted from filmmaking into the field of science development and science networking. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><ol class="c1 lst-kix_lxu5bkjpgwg9-0" start="6"><li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5">What is something that made you happy about doing research recently?</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">As an artist I&rsquo;m happy when I read someone else&rsquo;s research in cognitive sciences and neurobiology that validates some rationality of emotions.

It&rsquo;s about the Swiss based Human Brain Project that gained a 1 billion euro grant with the ambition to simulate human consciousness. The film is unusually critical towards the research project and it offers a unique inside view into the problem of over-promise that is rarely reflected in the media. Then I really enjoyed reading the research in psychology by Bessel van der Kolk (the author of The Body Keeps the Score) and Joseph Spinazzola (research on post traumatic stress and animal assisted intervention).</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><ol class="c1 lst-kix_lxu5bkjpgwg9-0" start="9"><li class="c2 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">What is some advice you would give to your younger-self or new researchers?</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Don&rsquo;t worry too much about your status.
