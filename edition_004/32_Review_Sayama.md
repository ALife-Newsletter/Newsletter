The most recent issue of the Journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI Journal) is a special issue featuring ALife, edited by Yasuhiro Hashimoto, Claus Aranha and Mizuki Oka.

Articles are all written in Japanese, but you can still try and check out its contents using machine translation (and also enjoy the gorgeous cover illustration of the issue created by Shun Iwasawa). [Read the special issue here](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jjsai/37/1/_contents/-char/ja)
