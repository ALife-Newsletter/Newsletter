# Paper Review: Artificial Life: Discipline or Method? Report on a Debate Held at ECAL '99 

By [Imy Khan](http://imytk.co.uk)

What value does Artificial Life - with its decades-rich history of research, diverse range of methods, and ever-growing focus and interest - bring to the scientific community at large? How does it advance our knowledge? Should we think about Artificial Life as its own discipline, that tries to identify and understand new problems, or give us new ways of thinking? Do we instead just see the methods that we use as a means of enquiry to existing problems? Or, perhaps, is "artificial life" just an excuse to be creative and wacky, all in the name of "scientific advancement"?

There is no easy answer to these questions, of course. That is why, at ECAL '99, a debate was held with some of the field's most promiment researchers, over these very questions.

Jason Noble, Seth Bullock and Ezequiel Di Paolo presented a report on this debate, which took place 25 years ago, and is still as relevant a conversation today as it was then. For anyone who hasn't yet had an opportunity to read this short (3 page) report yet, or if you need a short refresher on how that debate unfolded, I encourage you to give it a read! You can find the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1162/106454600568375). 

Who knows? Maybe it will make you change the way you view Artificial Life...
