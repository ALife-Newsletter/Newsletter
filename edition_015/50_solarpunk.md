# Solarpunk: Nature and Tech
Shared by Lana Sinapayen

You may have come in contact with the idea of [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk), through scifi books or video games, maybe even wihout realizing it!
Solarpunk envisions a future beyond capitalism, where humans use tech to live without overexploiting nature.
In this series of talks shared by the [Solarpunk Now!](https://spore.social/@solarpunkcast/111874256137288293) podcast, panelists from the [Solarpunk Conference](https://www.solarpunkconference.com/) share their visions of exiting capitalism and bringing solarpunk to the real world.
