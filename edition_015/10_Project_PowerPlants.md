# Featured Paper: Artificial "Power Plants"
Spotted by Lana

I can't help it, I love projects that mix plants and robotics! How could I resist this recent paper about fake leaves that produce real energy?
The leaves are "multi-source energy harvesters": they produce electricity from both windpower and falling rain.

Is it practical? Will it ever be used in real life to inconspicuously power street lamps? Let's be honest, it is pretty rare for this type of device to end up mass produced. But every time that progress is made, we get closer to that reality.
