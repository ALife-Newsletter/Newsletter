# A word from the team

Welcome to the 15th issue of the Alife Newsletter! Spring is soon coming to the northern hemisphere, so the theme for this newsletter is **Growth** - plant growth, robot healing, new opportunities with conferences, we got several interesting articles to end the 2023 academic year with a bang!

Talking about beginnings, one of our editors, Imy, has just started a new podcast, "What ALife!", which interviews members of the community. Listen it at [this link](LINK TO IMY'S PODCAST)

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other Alifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Gabriel
