# Report: 2nd Workshop of the Japanese Society of Alife

*by Mikihiro Sudaã€€(suda(at)websci.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp)*

On 2022-12-06, I participated in the workshop of the Japanese Society of Artificial Life. The purpose of this workshop was to share and discuss a wide range of research on artificial life. In fact, what impressed me the most was the great variety of research fields presented. In the oral presentation session, three researchers gave presentations. I presented my research on human relationships as an ecosystem and extracting keystone relationships from social networks. The other two researchers presented a study on emergence in the legal world from a computational perspective, and a study on wealth distribution in a multi-agent simulation with agents with personalities. Just by looking at the contents of these three presentations, you can see the diversity of research discussed at the workshop.

In addition to the oral presentations, there were also poster sessions and keynote speeches. The poster session used an online communication tool called Gather, where 12 posters were displayed in a user interface that resembled an RPG game. I was impressed by the very cheerful atmosphere of the entire workshop. I think one of the reasons is that there were many young participants, and I was able to see everywhere that the discussions were friendly and active.

Overall, I feel that it was a very meaningful workshop. I am deeply grateful to have been able to participate in such an occasion.
