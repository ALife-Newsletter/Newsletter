- **Vice Chair**: Barbora Hudcova - a second-year PhD student at Czech Technical University (Czech Republic)
- **ISAL Board Representative**: Richard Löffler - a post-doc researcher at the University of Trento. (Italy)

- **Equity Chair**: Imy Khan - a researcher at the University of Hertfordshire and University of Sussex (UK).
- **Conference Chair**: Federico Pigozzi - a second-year PhD student at the ​​University of Trieste (Italy)

The board is already hard at work making many changes which they will communicate in the next newsletter. If you are interested in joining the ERA group, feel free to join the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/isalstudents/shared_invite/zt-5t9huf34-bw3sKCY3mlfhEsIg4xcPCg)
