# Voices from ISAL -- Early Researchers Workshop Call

Dear all,

We would like to announce a new opportunity for early career researchers
funded by the John Templeton Foundation. Please feel welcome to share it to
colleagues within your personal networks.

A global call is now underway for applications from early career (*)
researchers from "biological chemistry", "non equilibrium physics" and
"artificial life" to an all-expenses paid workshop in central europe, June
2022. Thirty successful applicants will be flown to Prague CZ in late June
to spend a week forming teams that each propose how to advance current
frontiers in abiogenesis research. At the end of the week, these proposals
will have access to $5M total funding to implement their ideas. For further
information, an email for questions from potential applicants, and the
application form itself are all on the event website:

Thank you, and good luck everyone!

Best wishes,
Olaf
