Greg Egan asks the question “What counts as life?” in many different ways throughout the course of his 1994 novel Permutation City. In a world where brain copying and approximation is possible for the well-off and where virtual copies of people can live on after the donor’s death, what counts as immortality? Are you alive if you do not have a body? If you cannot age? If you were created outside of the universe you inhabit? If you edit the parts of yourself you don’t like in the “real world”?

Visionary Paul Durham is convinced there is another, more real form of virtual immortality than what brain scans offer, and he claims to have the capital and compute resources to pull it off. He enlists the help of Maria Deluca, an ALife researcher who dabbles in a cloud-based chemistry simulation environment called the Autoverse, to engineer the jewel in his crown. She is conflicted and suspicious, but what Paul wants her to design is too big a dream for her to pass up, even if she’s convinced it couldn’t ever really be run with the limits of modern computing systems. Neither of them fully understands what they are about to create together.

Permutation City expertly weaves philosophy, metaphysics, computer science, biology, and other disciplines into a compelling vision of a future where the pursuit of immortality is tied to the pursuit of artificial life. All of this is neatly explored in a compelling narrative featuring well rounded, believable characters who are not what they appear - neither the “real” humans nor their various digital counterparts. Though at times it is bleak and pessimistic, the book is also beautiful and full of wonder.

If we do ever create artificial life, what will we owe to our creations?

Who will we become?
