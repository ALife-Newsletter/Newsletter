# The 2022 Virtual Competition: Call for Submissions

Since the early 1990â€™s, virtual creatures have captured the imagination of artists, engineers, philosophers and scientists. Virtual creatures can now be found in our favorite animated movies, the design of useful robots and novel organisms, and the genesis of better explanations of nature and all of its creatures.

**Be part of the next generation of virtual creatures, and enter the 2022 Virtual Creatures Competition (VCC)!**

The VCC is now soliciting short films (under five minutes) from thinkers, builders, and artists, of their latest simulated artificial lifeforms. Submissions will be judged on their contribution to science (new explanatory theories), engineering (technical achievement), and art (aesthetic appeal). To enter, submit your five-minute film, along with a one page summary, before July 1.

**Deadline**: July 1, 2022

**Website**: [https://virtualcreatures.github.io](https://virtualcreatures.github.io)

**Organizers**: Caitlin Grasso, Kathryn Walker, Lana Sinapayen, Sam Kriegman.
