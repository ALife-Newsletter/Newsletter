# Finally, self-replicating RNA. A notch for the RNA-world orgin of life hypothesis

Gianni, Edoardo, et al. ["A small polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize itself and its complementary strand."](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt2760) Science (2026): eadt2760.

When it comes to the question of "How did Life get started on Earth?", the RNA-world hypothesis is probably the most popular. To get some sort of evolution by natural selection started, we need a function to which apply selection, a flexible coding molecule, and copy mechanism. Until now, experiments had shown that RNA polymerase ribozymes (long molecules made of RNA) could copy other small strands of RNA, but those ribozymes were too big and too complex to manage to replicate their own coding strands, let alone to have emerged by themselves.

This paper synthesized much smaller ribozymes (30 to 45 nucleotides instead of 150) that can build both their complementary RNA strand and the complementary to the complentary, ie a copy of themselves. The new strand then folds itself, ready to perform its function. Folks, we have self-replication! The issue of unprompted emergence remains.
