# ALife on the Media: Computers out of Brain Cells

The [BBC ran a news article last
year](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7p1lzvxjro) about the
efforts of a laboratory to create a computer using brain cells.

The [Final Spark](https://finalspark.com/) laboratory, out of
Switzerland, is researching how to create a "wet" computational
system. The idea is to make stem cells out of human skin cells, turn
those stem cells into neurons, and then send electrical signals to
these clumps of neurons, that they call "organoids".

The news state that while they aren't yet able to do computation with
these organoids, they respond to stimuli, and the laboratory is now
trying to understand the rules behind these responses.

The energy costs of animal brains is many order of magnitudes lower
than those of our current computational technologies, so one of the
hopes for this research is to discover a less costly computational
substrate. On the other hand, we must also not lose sight of the
potential ethical pitfalls of this kind of research: At what point do
we need to start considering the ethical treatment of biological
constructs the same way that we consider that of laboratory animals,
etc?
