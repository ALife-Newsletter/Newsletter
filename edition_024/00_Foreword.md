# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 24th issue of the ALife Newsletter! We hope you enjoyed the holiday calendar in our last edition. For this new year, our resolution is to implement the feedback you gave us in the survey!
For a start, in this edition we give you more of what you like: people and papers! An interview with Jenny Zhang, and a project from contributor Syed Sami. Two paper reviews, and a news article that will surely pick up the interest of Alifers.
