# Dynamical selection != natural selection: Biological reproduction as an emergent dynamical property 

Shared by Lana

Brette, Romain. "[A dynamical perspective on biological reproduction.](https://hal.science/hal-05491732)" (2026).

This paper explores the consequences of considering reproduction not from the point of view of replicating a genome, but from the point of view of mapping an organism to another, with the genome as a constraint on the mapping function.
The introduction does a really good job of walking you through examples showing that DNA is not a map of the organism: very different organisms can have identical DNA, some organisms have complex reproduction cycles where replication happens several times, etc.
It also offers a critique of Von Neumann's self replicating automaton, and defines the concept of Dynamical Selection, which selects for stable reproduction potentially regardless of fitness.
If you like hand drawn chickens and frogs, I recommend reading the full paper.
