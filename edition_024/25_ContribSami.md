# Contributions from Our Readers: GenesisSim
*summarized by Claus*

Reader Syed Sami sent us information about their project
[GenesisSim](https://github.com/syedsamiullah45/GenesisSim), an ALife
Simulator. GenesisSim, inspired by the book "Growing Artificial
Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up" (1996), includes both
biological and social components to the simulation.

More details about the project, from the words of Syed:

> I’ve been working on GenesisSim, a lightweight Python simulation
> where digital organisms evolve both biologically and
> culturally. Unlike systems such as Tierra, Avida, or Lenia,
> GenesisSim uses dual inheritance: agents pass down not only genes,
> but also symbols (“glyphs”), so cultural identities evolve alongside
> biology.

> This enables symbolic drift, branching, and diversification, with
> culture itself acting as an evolutionary substrate — all inside a
> single script, no GPUs or black-box AI. In short: GenesisSim lets
> symbols evolve like genes, unifying cultural and biological evolution
> in silico.
