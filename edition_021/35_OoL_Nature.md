# Paper Review: Evolution of complex chemical mixtures reveals combinatorial compression and population synchronicity (Matange et al., 2025)

Summary by Imy

The previous paper presented by Claus is not the only Origins of Life paper to make it into this issue. [This recent paper, written by Kavita Matange and colleagues, published in Nature Chemistry and accessible here,](https://williams.chemistry.gatech.edu/publications/LDW_162.pdf)) offers another perspective in the ongoing quest to understand the origins of life here on Earth. It aims to understand how the simple prebiotic chemicals readily available on early Earth might have transitioned into the more complex molecular assemblies necessary for the emergence of life. 

Rather than focusing on individual reactions, this study examines the behaviour of entire chemical systems under simulated early Earth conditions. The authors developed an experimental model simulating early Earth conditions using fluctuating water activity and near-ambient temperatures to drive the evolution of organic molecule mixtures containing key functional groups.

The researchers observed three key phenomena: (1) the chemical systems underwent continuous change without reaching a stable equilibrium, (2) they demonstrated 'combinatorial compression' where a limited number of products were formed despite a large number of possible combinations, indicating stringent chemical selection, and (3) different molecular species exhibited 'synchronicity of molecular populations', meaning their concentrations rose and fell in coordinated ways. These findings suggest that even simple environmental fluctuations could drive a non-chaotic progression towards molecular complexity.

Their findings challenge the idea of a purely chaotic prebiotic environment. Instead, they observed that their chemical systems underwent continuous change without reaching equilibrium, demonstrating combinatorial compression with stringent chemical selection and a surprising synchronicity of molecular populations. The authors propose that simple environmental oscillations could have acted as a powerful engine for the generation of increasingly complex chemical species, the very building blocks of life.
