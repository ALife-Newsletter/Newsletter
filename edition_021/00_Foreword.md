# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 21st issue of the ALife Newsletter! 

[Never miss an issue by subscribing here](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89).

In this edition, we are proud to unveil our first-ever omnibus of ALife-related videos! Witness tiny lifelike pets made from sand, as well as the emergence of lifelike forms from bio-inspired music & art. Explore DIY genetic engineering, see how vision/graphics models are used to both discover and create agents, and learn about the physics of living systems. Immerse yourself in ALife simulations, and you may even choose to become involved in one yourself!

This month, we have also focused on the origins of life, as well as the origin of eyes. And Complexity Cat is here to help us reach a new understanding of living systems.

As we look forward to the upcoming conference in Kyoto, there is another submission looming: the deadline for creating the official ALIFE2025 mascot! And to get in the spirit, be sure not to miss the most recent conference-themed What ALife! podcast.

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [contribution form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other ALifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!
