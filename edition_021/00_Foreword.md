If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [contribution form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other ALifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!
