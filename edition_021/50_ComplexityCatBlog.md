# Blog Post Review: "Relational Biology I: Is it possible to simulate life? - Complexity Cat"

Summary by Imy

What's the real difference between a biological model and a simulation, and why is this distinction crucial for understanding life?
	
Complexity Cat recently started [(a new blog series)](https://amahury.github.io/posts/trilogy-relational-biology-I/) exploring the field of relational biology, pioneered by Robert Rosen. Moving beyond a purely reductionist view of life's molecular components, relational biology emphasises the organisational relationships and interactions that define living systems. This first post introduces these ideas to readers, and directly tackles a common misinterpretation that Rosen outright denied the possibility of simulating life.

Instead, the blog post argues that Rosen's work (alongside that of his mentor, Nicolas Rashevsky) suggests that traditional, algorithmic simulations may inherently struggle to capture the essence of living systems, particularly their closure to efficient causation i.e. the ability of a system's components to generate and maintain their own organisation. The blog post clarifies the Rosen's distinction between abstract models and computational simulations and discusses how relational approaches offer a different lens for understanding the fundamental principles of life.
