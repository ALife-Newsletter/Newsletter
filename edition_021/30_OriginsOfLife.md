# Paper Review: "Concomitant formation of protocells and prebiotic compounds under a plausible early Earth Atmosphere"

Summary by Claus

[Nate Gaylinn](https://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn) shared on Mastodon a [paper about a recent experiment on the origins of life](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413816122). In this paper, the authors prepare an environment that mimics the conditions of early earth, and conduct lighting experiments in this environment. The goal was to find evidence of the early blocks of life, and understand the range of necessary conditions for life on earth and possibly in other worlds.

Or, as [Nate puts it much better in his original post](https://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn/114002744361757569): 

> "Like Miller and Urey before them, these researchers simulated a tiny pond on ancient earth, and struck it with "lightning."

> They confirmed this produces biochemicals, but this time they used advanced microscopy to show it also produces tiny bubbles that look surprisingly lifelike on their own, and could serve as shelters for protolife.

> Awesome finding! This really could have been important for life's origins (though, to be properly alive, the protocell would need to be able to make its own vesicle, and divide it). It's a little disheartening, though, as this new evidence makes the search for microbial fossils that much harder.

> Understanding what life is and how it made itself what we see today is a real challenge. We're coming onto the scene a few billion years too late! Mostly, we must rely on our imagination and simulations, so when we get some new clues from the physical sciences, that's always a treat. This experiment shows us a new affordance available to primordial life, and gives some clues about how to interpret microfossils in the archaeological record.

The paper itself is not very long, and has nice pictures of the experimental setup, so make sure to give it a read!
