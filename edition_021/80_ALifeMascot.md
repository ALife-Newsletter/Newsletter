# Competition: Design the Official Mascot for ALIFE2025!

Summary by Imy

Hey! Want to win a free registration to this year's ALIFE 2025 conference?

The 2025 Artificial Life conference is happening in Kyoto, Japan, and we want YOU to design the official mascot to be the face of the conference. We're seeking a unique character to embody the spirit of ALIFE - whatever that means to you. This is your opportunity to leave a lasting mark on the ALIFE community and become a part of conference history and folklore.

All you need to do is submit your visual sketch or rendering, a catchy and memorable name, and an optional short backstory explaining your mascot's connection to artificial life and the ALIFE 2025 conference. The winning design will become the official face of the conference, featured on the website, social media, merchandise, and potentially even as a life-sized costume!

Did we already mention winning a free registration to the ALIFE 2025 conference?

All community members – researchers, students, enthusiasts, and artists – are encouraged and invited to participate. Let your imagination flourish and help us bring the ALIFE 2025 spirit to life!

The deadline for submissions is June 15th, 2025. Don't miss this exciting chance to contribute your vision and potentially attend ALIFE 2025 for free! Submit your design today!
