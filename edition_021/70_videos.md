"The Physics of Living Systems" with Chris Kempes for "Reason with Science" 
![](images/kempes.png)

"This episode is with Chris Kempes, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, working at the fascinating intersection of physics and biology. Chris joins us to talk about some of the most profound questions about life starting from fundamental definitions to exploring life's potential multiple origins guided by the laws of physics. Join us as we explore the role of energy landscapes in Prebiotic chemistry, the physical basis of microbial behaviors, scaling laws that govern life's metabolic patterns, and how collective behaviors emerge in multicellular organisms. Let's embark on a journey to rethink life's mysteries through the lens of physics."

"London 1940" by ‪Tom Barbalet

"Tom talks about his London1940.org simulation project that really needs a particular kind of developer to pick it up."

 “Robots and Artificial Life from Visual Foundation Models”, a talk by Phillip Isola (MIT) for Spring 2025 GRASP on Robotics.

ABSTRACT
"I will talk about two ways we can design agents with the help of powerful vision/graphics models. In the first project, LucidSim, we augment a traditional robotics simulation engine (MuJoCo) with visual detail from an image generative model. The generator adds diversity and realism to the barebones MuJoCo content, and results in a RGB-only policy trained entirely in sim that generalizes zero-shot to the real world. In the second project, ASAL, we use a visual recognition model to search for artificial lifeforms that display distinct and interesting behaviors. This process can discover cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway’s Game of Life, particle swarms that flock like Boids, and more."
