<h1 id="review-of-the-agent-learning-in-open-endedness-workshop">Review of the Agent Learning in Open-Endedness Workshop</h1>
<p><em>By <a href="https://twitter.com/kvfrans">Kevin Frans</a></em></p>
<p>Open-endedness is the idea of a system that "endlessly creates increasingly interesting designs". That's a simple concept with big implications, especially for those of us interested in AI and the emergence of intelligence. Because even with powerful learning algorithms, intelligence is one of those tricky things that's hard and complicated to specify. But that's the beauty of open-ended systems: they can generate unexpected designs, designs that go beyond the intention of the designer. And so even if intelligence is hard to create, it might be possible to create a system where intelligence naturally emerges. This weekend, a bunch of us thinking about how open-endedness can boost AI gathered at the Agent Learning in Open-Endedness (ALOE) workshop at ICLR.</p>
<p>Many projects were presented, mainly centering around the question of "how can we generate training tasks that are rich, learnable, yet increasingly complex?". XLand aims to create an open-ended set of tasks by 1) defining a distribution of games, and 2) making them all multi-agent. The key lesson is that XLand tasks are so varied and dense that agents have no choice but to generalize. Sam Earle presented work on procedural content generation, showing that AI models could be used as level generators, resulting in a competitive game between AI players and AI designers. PAIRED, presented by Natasha Jaques, examines the game theory of this framework, and shows that a strong training curriculum can arise from a game between a designer, an antagonist, and a protagonist. The designer tries to propose tasks which the antagonist can solve, but the protagonist cannot, a metric which empirically corresponds to tasks just on the learning boundary. Finally, Julius Togelius argued that our classic framework of "agents interacting with an environment" is too limiting, and we should explore new ground.</p>

<p><strong>"Evolutionary transition from a single RNA replicator to a multiple replicator network"</strong></p>
<p>by <a href="https://twitter.com/vespid">Mituyoshi Yamazaki</a></p>
<p>This research is an attempt to realize a host-parasite coevolution model aiming at Open-Ended Evolution.
<em><a href="https://webpark2056.sakura.ne.jp/papers/2022_Mizuuchi.pdf">https://webpark2056.sakura.ne.jp/papers/2022_Mizuuchi.pdf</a></em></p>
<h2 id="research-content">Research Content</h2>
<p>The following two conditions are necessary for evolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-replication ability</li>
<li>Inheritance of changes in replication ability</li>
</ul>
<p>How to build a simple model that meets these conditions?</p>
<h3 id="previous-research">Previous Research</h3>
<p>In Spiegelmann's previous study, self-replicating RNA was evolved by feeding it raw material and an RNA-replicating enzyme to replicate it, and repeating the same procedure for the next generation. As a result, RNA converged on the shortest gene that has a trait with high replication efficiency. </p>
<p><em>Cause of convergence:</em>
- The selection pressure of RNA did not change because only RNA was passed in each procedure and the same type of RNA replication enzyme was added.
- The information encoded by RNA was meaningless (the genetic information encoding the protein was included but not used for replication procedure)
    - The susceptibility to replication depended only on the physical properties of RNA and the replication enzyme.</p>
<h3 id="research-by-professor-ichihashi">Research by Professor Ichihashi</h3>
<p>In this paper, Professor Ichihashi continues the previous work by introducing a cell-free protein synthesis, and implementing a model in which RNA makes an RNA-replicating enzyme and the replicating enzyme makes RNA. RNA mutations also affect replication enzymes, avoiding convergence by changing the selection pressure of the system.</p>
<p>Along with that change, they introduced a cellular structure. (In order to prevent the generated RNA-replicating enzyme from drifting somewhere, the cell structure pre-encloses RNA and the necessary nutrients. If it drifts, the tragedy of the commons arises).</p>
<p>As a result of conducting experiments on such a system, the introduction of a cell-free protein synthesis system was not enough, and it converged and stopped evolving.</p>
<p>At this point, the parasite had already developed, but it was suppressed to not inhibit the host's self-renewal. After removing the repression and subculturing for a while, co-evolution began with the RNA of the host and the RNA of the parasite, and new parasites were born.</p>
<h3 id="specifications-of-the-system-that-produces-parasites">Specifications of the system that produces parasites</h3>
<p>There is room for parasites to occur in this system (parasites seem to almost always appear) because there are vulnerabilities in the replication process that can be used by others. In this system, RNA does not replicate by itself, but has a structure that allows an RNA replication enzyme to replicate itself. RNA with a sequence ★ recognized by the replication enzyme as the replication target is replicated. The parasite is RNA of sequence ★ that lacks a gene that encodes a replicating enzyme, and because of this missing gene, the parasite's sequence is shorter and therefore it has a faster replication rate than that of the host RNA.</p>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<h3 id="specifications-of-the-system-that-produces-parasites_1">Specifications of the system that produces parasites</h3>
<p>This does not depend on the specific implementation target, so it can be installed in any kind of system including software simulators. In particular, Professor Ikegami's Machines and Tapes system seems to be easy to embed because the model structure is similar.</p>
<h3 id="multi-phased-self-replication-process">Multi-phased self-replication process</h3>
<p>The multi-phased process automatically removes the difficulty of self-referencing.</p>
<h3 id="explanation-that-evolved-from-rna-world-to-single-cell">Explanation that evolved from RNA world to single cell</h3>
<p>This research / experiment is, as it is, an explanation of how the RNA world has evolved into a single cell.</p>
<p>Since RNA needs a cellular structure to make and retain a replicating enzyme, it becomes a prerequisite for self-renewal. From that starting point, it already is the simplest form of a cell and easily developed into a fully functional ancestral cell.</p>
