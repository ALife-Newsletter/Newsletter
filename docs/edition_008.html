<h1 id="a-word-from-the-team">A word from the team</h1>
<p>Welcome to the 8th issue of the ALife Newsletter. As 2022 is drawing to
a close, we hope that everyone is having a great fall or spring!</p>
<p>This month we got two very interesting projects to share: A free book
on Conway's Game of Life by Nathaniel and Dave, and an Alife 
Simulation in Pico8 by Lj. We are particularly intersted in showcasing 
smaller projects like the last one, that inspire people to prototype and 
share their own ideas of what Alife could be!</p>
<p>Also this month we introduce our first regular column, "Creature of the Month"
by Domenic from Astrovitae, sharing a little bit of speculative 
bio to tickle everyone's mind each edition. If you have an idea for a 
regular column, please reach out! For example, we would love to have 
someone who could review alife inspired games for the newsletter.</p>
<p>As usual, we welcome contributions, ideas and suggestions to the newsletter 
at <a href="https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9">this form</a>! In particular, we are 
specially interested in Master and PhD students who want to talk about their 
own research ideas. Do send us a line!</p>
<p>If you'd like to receive our e-mails, you can subscribe <a href="https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="conways-game-of-life">Conway's Game of Life</h1>
<h2 id="mathematics-and-construction">Mathematics and Construction</h2>
<p><a href="https://conwaylife.com/book/">A free book</a> by Nathaniel Johnston and Dave Greene</p>
<p>Blurb by <a href="http://www.njohnston.ca/">Nathaniel Johnston</a></p>
<p>This book provides an introduction to Conway's Game of Life, the interesting mathematics behind it, and the methods used to construct many of its most interesting patterns. The book starts by exploring many of the well-known patterns like blinkers and gliders, but quickly shifts its focus to the problem of combining these various components into complicated mega-structures that can perform unexpectedly complex tasks. In particular, the books guides the reader through the construction of patterns that are able to perform arbitrary computations, are able to create copies of themselves, and even patterns that mimic biological cells by having a central helix of DNA that controls its behavior and replication cycle.</p>
<p>While the book largely follows the history of the Game of Life, that is not its primary purpose. Rather, it is a by-product of the fact that most recently discovered patterns build upon patterns and techniques that were developed earlier. The goal of this book is to demystify the Game of Life by breaking down the complex patterns that have been developed in it into bite-size chunks that can be understood individually.</p>
<p>(Comment by Lana: Not only is the book free, but you can run every game of life patterns from the book by copy pasting the code in a web-based game of life engine like https://golly.sourceforge.net/!)</p>

<h1 id="astrovitaes-creature-of-the-month-the-onyx-flutter-flea">Astrovitae's Creature of the Month - The Onyx Flutter Flea</h1>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/domenicpennetta">Domenic V. Pennetta</a></p>
<p>Last month I shared the speculative biology magazine Astrovitae with 
the ALife community. After many excited responses from ALife members, 
I now plan on sharing a creature from Astrvoitae Magazine every month! 
In each newsletter a speculative biology artist and their chosen 
creature design will be showcased for all to see. For this initial 
"Creature of the Month", I want to showcase the first ever creature 
featured in Astrovitae, the onyx flutter flea, which was published on the 
cover of issue 1!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_008/astrovitae_flutterflea.jpg" /></p>
<p>From the naked eye, these small planktonic creatures appear to float using 
a "halo" or "ring". However under closer inspection this halo is in fact 
the specimen’s forearms locked in place above its head. This particular s
pecies of flutter flea has been identified within the oceans of the 
exoplanet Perdita c, and is named Anellusbrachium onyx (a.k.a. the onyx 
flutter flea). Its large forearms forming the halo are used for feeding; 
often outstretched and are able to clamp shut when another planktonic 
organism wriggles by. Once caught, prey items will become ensnared by 
sharp follicles, and are held in place long enough to be pierced by the 
onyx flutter flea’s proboscis. Like other species of flutter fleas, A. onyx 
is found in aggregates, passively waiting in the water column for 
unsuspecting victims. </p>

<h1 id="picoworld">Picoworld</h1>
<p>by Lj Miranda (<a href="https://twitter.com/ljvmiranda921">@ljvmiranda921</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io/picoworld"><strong>Picoworld</strong></a> is a PICO-8 simulation
that explores the concept of <em>emergence</em> and <em>self-organization</em>. In this
sandbox game, you define a set of particles and their interaction rules.
Particles, by themselves, can only attract or repel one another. However, from
these simple interactions, we can observe complex phenomena.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_008/picoworld_simple.gif" /></p>
<p>I chose Pico-8 as the game engine for Picoworld because I like its small and
portable nature--like a petri dish! However, developing on Pico-8 requires you
to lean into its constraints: you are limited to a 16-color palette, a 128x128
pixel resolution, and a set amount of programming tokens. This forces me to be
more deliberate in what features I need to add (or remove). It pushes me to
achieve simplicity, and what's fun is that just like any ALife concept,
simplicity can lead to emergent complexity.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_008/picoworld_sample.gif" /></p>
<p>The way Picoworld works is that you have four different types of colored
particles. Using the editor, you can define how many particles of each type to
spawn and their corresponding interaction (attraction/repulsion). You can do
this by toggling the symbol in the editor until you reach the desired value:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_008/picoworld_editor.gif" /></p>
<p>Because of Pico-8 constraints, there is only a set number of population and
attraction/repulsion strength available. However, these are already enough to
create fun simulations! </p>

<img alt="" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_008/picoworld_token2.png" /></p>
<p>My goal for Picoworld is to encourage experimentation on this artificial life
system. If you discover interesting patterns, feel free to share a screenshot of
the configuration as a comment on the itch.io page! Lastly, I love working in
ALife and collective intelligence, so you can check out my other works!

<h1 id="sf-review-koichi-harukure-mortal-game">SF Review: Koichi Harukure "Mortal Game"</h1>
<p>A short story in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0B2HWFXDX">SF Magazine 2022/08</a></p>
<p><em>By <a href="http://twitter.com/vespid">Mitsuyoshi Yamazaki</a></em></p>
<p>The Search for Interstellar Life project has discovered an organic cellular automaton. The rules are deterministic, and calculations show that all "cells" will disappear in the near future.
Cellular automata are life-like if they are self-replicators that spontaneously reproduce from their environment, whereas a phenomenon whose behavior can be computed deterministically cannot be treated as life.
Should we leave the automaton untouched and let it "go extinct" in order not to disturb its natural environment, or should we "breed" it and modify the rules to foster long-period patterns?
The team's conclusion is…</p>
<p>This is the story of a human being's journey to an alien planet in search of an unknown phenomenon, the discovery of a phenomenon that fulfills that very purpose, and how humans deal with things that cannot be captured within the framework of existing science.
The spontaneous generation of an organic automaton is a plausible scenario, considering the spontaneous generation of life, and the life-like nature of such a quasi-life form is exactly what is being discussed in the artificial life field.</p>
<p>Can we call a phenomenon whose behavior can be deterministically determined life?<br />
If it is life, can we call an electronically simulated pattern of that phenomenon life?<br />
Would we not call life a being that survives by any means and resists its own destruction?  </p>
<p>But the focus of this story is not the alien cellular automaton, nor the discussion of its vitality, but the outpouring of human imagination and creativity towards the unknown.
The conclusion of introducing non-deterministic elements into a deterministic system is exactly one direction of artificial life production toward an Open-Ended system.</p>
<p>See for yourself how this story will end.</p>
<h1 id="era-board-update-202223">ERA Board Update 2022/23</h1>
<p><em>By <a href="http://twitter.com/imy_tk">Imy Khan</a></em></p>
<p>The nomination and voting process for the Emerging Researchers in ALife Board for the 2022/23 is currently taking place (at the time of writing - perhaps, by the time this newsletter is sent out, the results will have been finalised!). As always, there are six positions on the board: General Chair, Vice Chair, Communications Chair, Equity Chair, Conference Chair, and ISAL Representative. The results of the election will be posted on the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/isalstudents/shared_invite/zt-1g7e8aex2-JKCdL53xOxs2dlRGG38R7A">ERA Slack</a> as well as the <a href="http://twitter.com/isalstudents">Twitter account</a>. We hope to welcome and introduce the new board in the next newsletter issue. For now, check out either the Slack or Twitter to find more details of the board and the chairs.</p>
<p>For now, if you are interested in becoming a member of the Emerging Researchers in ALife group, then all you need to do is <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/isalstudents/shared_invite/zt-1g7e8aex2-JKCdL53xOxs2dlRGG38R7A">join the Slack workspace</a>. There, we can keep you up-to-date with ERA-related events, and you will be able to nominate and vote in future board elections.</p>
