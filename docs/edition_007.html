<p>Welcome to the 6th issue of the ALife Newsletter. Summer is here in the North hemisphere and we are all being boiled alive, but hopefully this fresh newsletter will help cooling you down!</p>
<p>This edition has several paper reviews, a course review, and two workshop summaries! If you attended an ALife event recently, let us know.</p>
<p>The Newsletter is distributed by email, and archived on the International Society for Artificial Life's website.</p>
<p>You can subscribe <a href="https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89">here</a>.</p>
<p>Contribute to any section of the next newsletter <a href="https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9">here</a>! We are specially interested in Master and PhD students who want to talk about their own research.</p>
<p>Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Katt.</p>

<p>In these clips, paraffin droplets containing different concentration combinations of camphor and the dye Oil red O were placed on a pure water surface. Droplets develop different behaviors such as tendrils, which form a maze-like space filling structure before splitting into smaller droplets that periodically move and trigger waves of activity or slowly morphing larger droplets. The behavior comes from the camphor in the droplet/s being deposited onto the water surface where it lowers the surface tension temporarily until it evaporates from the surface again, causing a marangoni convection in the bulk water phase that triggers a surface flow. Furthermore, the dye in the droplet lowers the interfacial tension between oil and water which enables the droplet to expand without splitting immediately.

<blockquote>
<p>"Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <em>Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin</em></p>
<p>If you want to understand a group of humans — where they live, how they speak, what they value, how they use their time or what they are proud of, a good place to start is with <strong>how they eat</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd like to place the deep bond between food and culture at the heart of an interactive experience: What can you learn from a group of people, based on what they eat?</p>
<h2 id="explore-a-world-through-its-cookbook"><em>Explore a world through its cookbook</em></h2>
<p><strong><em>Tell Me What You Eat</em></strong> is an in-development game where players are invited to discover human cultures living in a fictional world, using their cooking practices as a red thread. If I tell you how they prepare food, can you piece together their history, where they lived, how they spoke, what they loved?</p>
<p>We intend to make <strong><em>Tell Me What You Eat</em></strong> a sort of <em>generative detective</em> game: each time you replay it, the world you explore will be recreated anew. New landmaps, new plants, new populations, new historical events — that will in turn, influence the recipes of this world. You might want to cook one of these recipes yourself, or try to imagine with your friends which kind of world exist around them.</p>
<h2 id="prototypes-experiments">Prototypes &amp; Experiments</h2>
<p><img alt="Prototype Screenshot" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_007/tellmewhatyoueat_nagada.png" /></p>
<p>Our various prototypes and playful experiments are all available on the <a href="https://github.com/Pyrofoux/Tell-Me-What-You-Eat/">Github repo</a>.</p>
<p>The repository contains:
- a first rough prototype of generating a fictional world's cookbook;
- a tentative at cooking a fictional recipe;
- a simulation of how places get their names from the people they are traversed by;</p>
<p><em>Editor's note</em>: Many Alife projects focus on the evolution of biology, agency, and intelligence. But another important aspect of living creatures is the culture they produce by their lived experiences!</p>
