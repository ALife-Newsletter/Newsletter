<p>arranged by Claus</p>
<p>Several of our readers sent their projects to share through the newsletter. Take a look!</p>
<p>If you would like to talk about your project (even if it is still in progress), send us a message through the <a href="https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89">feedback form</a>, send us a message through discord (we are all on the ISAL discord server), or send a message to our <a href="https://fediscience.org/@alifenewsletter">Mastodon account</a>! </p>
<p>We are always happy to highlight the work of our readers. Please add a short blurb (300 words or less) describing what you want to share. Pictures are specially welcome!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-train-your-drone-a-pictorial-by-joseph-la-delfa">"How to Train your Drone", a pictorial by Joseph La Delfa:</h2>
<p>What if you wrote a paper in the shape of a picture book? That's what Joseph did with his paper published at DIS24, about the design and testing of a system called "how to train your drone", that grants users partial control over the shape of the drone's sensory apparatus. In doing so, bespoke control mappings and behaviour emerges.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660737">read it in the ACM digital library</a> -- take a look, the paper is very pleasing to the eye! We need more creative designs to break away from the boring walls of text-and-equations.</p>
<p>The paper also draws some parallels between Alife and “research through design”. RtD is a family of design practices that focus more on emergence than problem solving. Joseph thinks there should be more bridges between the two communities. </p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://youtu.be/OWNibNLjtdU">Joseph talk about the parallels between the two communities at the ERA workshop in this video!</a> He also recommends a video documentary about RtD called <a href="https://vimeo.com/961000450">Permission to muck about</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hyperneat-substrate-design-tool-by-b-from-the-isal-discord-server">HyperNEAT Substrate design tool, by b from the ISAL Discord Server</h2>
<p>b has been developing a tool for defining HyperNEAT substrates to help simplify the process. The tool is currently used by them for their own projects, but they are looking for people to check their work and provide feedback!</p>
<p><a href="https://tkwn2080.github.io/substrate-designer">You can check you the tool in b's website.</a> The basic idea is to allow the user to visually design semi-complex HyperNEAT substrates in a way that can easily interface with code. In particular, b is using this to construct spiking neural networks.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-emergent-complexity-with-mettagrid-by-david-bloomin">Exploring Emergent Complexity with MettaGrid, by David Bloomin</h2>

<p>Shared by <a href="http://twitter.com/imy_tk">Imy Khan</a></p>
<p>Making ALife more accessible to the masses is one of the coolest things our community can do.</p>
<p>Michael Finn has reintroduced Sims' famous <a href="https://karlsims.com/evolved-virtual-creatures.html">Evolved Virtual Creatures</a> into the world: this time, no coding required! The Simsulator is an open-source platform for simulating Sims' Evolved Virtual Creatures, providing tools to evolve, breed, experiment on the virtual creatures. This is a really great piece of software for those who haven't yet had a chance to be hands-on with EVC and want an intuitive way to play with (and study) them. It's also a really great educational tool, providing a really accessible, intuitive way to explore artificial life and evolutionary computation.</p>

<p>Edited by Imy Khan</p>
<p>Jack Armitage is a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://iil.is/">Intelligent Instruments Lab, Iceland</a>: an interdisciplinary research lab that investigates the role of artificial intelligence in new musical instruments. </p>
<p>Based on a desire for more diversity of real-time AI (and ALife) in music interaction, Jack developed a library called <a href="https://intelligent-instruments-lab.github.io/tolvera/">Tölvera</a>. Tölvera is a Python library designed for composing together and interacting with basal agencies, inspired by fields such as artificial life (ALife) and self-organising systems. It provides creative coding-style APIs that allow users to combine and compose various built-in behaviours, such as flocking, slime mold growth, and swarming, and also author their own. </p>

<p>Check out the relevant paper, "Tölvera: Composing With Basal Agencies" <a href="http://iil.is/pdf/2024_nime_armitage_et_al_tolvera.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Call for Collaborators: Jack is looking for researchers from across ALife, biology and complex systems to collaborate with in using and extending the software project Tölvera.

<h1 id="book-review-morphotrophic-by-greg-egan-2024">Book Review: Morphotrophic, by Greg Egan (2024)</h1>
<p>Shared by Lana Sinapayen</p>
<p>What if we couldn't take multicellularity for granted, and every cell had the potential to revert to unicellularity it it felt like it?
What if these unicellular entities could be convinced to get back to communal life, and integrate another body plan?
Many of Greg Egan's are very popular in the ALife community, but this one is special: it was inspired by the work of the team behind the Xenobots project, work that received the 2021 Award for Outstanding Publication from the International Society for Artificial Life! </p>
<p>I couldn't put the book down. Beyond the raw interest of the scientific concepts, the social and philosophical implications are so well integrated in the world building that you'll find yourself empathising with many of the characters even if when you don't agree with their motivations.
A must-read.</p>

<p>Giliam de Carpentier designed this table by using genetic algorithms to select the best linkages for the table legs. For those familiar with Theo Jansen's strandbeests, the carpentopod's linkages are actually more compact and allow for a more robust walking gait.
Evolution, often one step ahead of human design... </p>

<h1 id="alife-2024-retrospective">ALife 2024 Retrospective</h1>
<p>By <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gabrieljulianoseverino/home">Gabriel J Severino</a></p>
<p>I feel as though the 2024 conference theme, “Exploring New Frontiers,” couldn’t have come at a better time. For over 30 years, the ALife community has embraced a spirit of exploration, often prioritizing discovery and innovation over immediate practical application. This is what makes the field so fascinating—there’s a real excitement in the unknown. The trade-off between exploring new ideas and exploiting established ones is a challenge every scientific field faces, and ALife has clearly hit the ‘explore’ button with vigor.</p>
<p>The theme felt particularly resonant this year because it touches on a broader question: what does it mean to explore new frontiers in science today? In the age of AI and computational advances, exploration often feels synonymous with pushing technological boundaries, but in ALife, it also means embracing creative, interdisciplinary approaches to understanding life itself. The sheer diversity of ideas and approaches showcased at ALife 2024 was a testament to this mindset. From evolutionary robotics to synthetic biology, from digital organisms to emergent social behaviors, the conference truly reflected breadth of research ecompasses by ALife.</p>
<p>As the conference theme suggests, this is also a good time to reflect on what a “fundamental science of artificial life” might look like. The field has long been about understanding the principles of life and intelligence, but the boundaries of ALife remain somewhat fluid, which can be both a strength and a limitation. This flexibility allows ALife to engage with broad interdisciplinary methodologies, integrating several different discplines, such as computational modeling, experimental biology, and robotics. However, the absense of a clearly defined set of theoretical foundations can make it difficult to identify exactly what scientific questions ALife, as a discipline, is uniquely positioned to answer. Other fields, such as mathematical biology or cognitive science, also grapple with questions about life and intelligence. What makes ALife distinct?</p>
<p>These questions of identity and purpose seemed to continually reemerge in conversations with a variety of different researchers (both from within ALife and from those visiting from other fields) throughout the week, reflecting a tension between exploration and exploitation—the same tension faced by any field navigating the fine line between speculative, fundamental research and more applied, outcome-driven work. In ALife, the spirit of exploration is very much alive. But there’s also an emerging recognition of the importance of balancing this exploration with clearer scientific foundations. This balance is crucial for the continued development of the field, as it provides the grounding necessary for sustained progress while maintaining the sense of intellectual curiosity that makes ALife so unique.</p>
<p>What truly stood out to me, however, was the sense of community and collaboration that permeated the event—particularly among early-career researchers. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/emergingresearchersinal">Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA)</a> events were a huge success, providing a great oppurtunity for newer members of the ALife community to connect, share their work, and build collaborations. These events not only helped break down barriers but also fostered a genunie connection between people excited about the same niche things. ERA events, such as the "coffee" roundtable (which was really just a little party) and the always-entertaining Academic Karaoke night, allowed folks to really connect with each other in a fun, relaxed environment.</p>
<p>Personally, while the intellectual stimulation and inspiration were immense, the most rewarding part of the conference was the opportunity to meet and connect with so many awesome and brilliant people.</p>
<p>If you couldn't attend <a href="https://2024.alife.org/index.html">ALife 2024</a>, or if you had to prioritize one talk over another, you can still check out the work that peaks your interest in the <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2024/36/1/123556">proceedings</a>.
