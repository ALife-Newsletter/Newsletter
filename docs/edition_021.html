<h1 id="paper-review-concomitant-formation-of-protocells-and-prebiotic-compounds-under-a-plausible-early-earth-atmosphere">Paper Review: "Concomitant formation of protocells and prebiotic compounds under a plausible early Earth Atmosphere"</h1>
<p>Summary by Claus</p>
<p><a href="https://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn">Nate Gaylinn</a> shared on Mastodon a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413816122">paper about a recent experiment on the origins of life</a>. In this paper, the authors prepare an environment that mimics the conditions of early earth, and conduct lighting experiments in this environment. The goal was to find evidence of the early blocks of life, and understand the range of necessary conditions for life on earth and possibly in other worlds.</p>
<p>Or, as <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@ngaylinn/114002744361757569">Nate puts it much better in his original post</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Like Miller and Urey before them, these researchers simulated a tiny pond on ancient earth, and struck it with "lightning."</p>
<p>They confirmed this produces biochemicals, but this time they used advanced microscopy to show it also produces tiny bubbles that look surprisingly lifelike on their own, and could serve as shelters for protolife.</p>
<p>Awesome finding! This really could have been important for life's origins (though, to be properly alive, the protocell would need to be able to make its own vesicle, and divide it). It's a little disheartening, though, as this new evidence makes the search for microbial fossils that much harder.</p>
<p>Understanding what life is and how it made itself what we see today is a real challenge. We're coming onto the scene a few billion years too late! Mostly, we must rely on our imagination and simulations, so when we get some new clues from the physical sciences, that's always a treat. This experiment shows us a new affordance available to primordial life, and gives some clues about how to interpret microfossils in the archaeological record.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper itself is not very long, and has nice pictures of the experimental setup, so make sure to give it a read!</p>

<p>Summary by Imy</p>
<p>The previous paper presented by Claus is not the only Origins of Life paper to make it into this issue. This recent paper, written by Kavita Matange and colleagues, published in Nature Chemistry and accessible <a href="https://williams.chemistry.gatech.edu/publications/LDW_162.pdf">here,</a>
offers another perspective in the ongoing quest to understand the origins of life here on Earth. It aims to understand how the simple prebiotic chemicals readily available on early Earth might have transitioned into the more complex molecular assemblies necessary for the emergence of life. </p>
<p>Rather than focusing on individual reactions, this study examines the behaviour of entire chemical systems under simulated early Earth conditions. The authors developed an experimental model simulating early Earth conditions using fluctuating water activity and near-ambient temperatures to drive the evolution of organic molecule mixtures containing key functional groups.</p>
<p>The researchers observed three key phenomena: (1) the chemical systems underwent continuous change without reaching a stable equilibrium, (2) they demonstrated 'combinatorial compression' where a limited number of products were formed despite a large number of possible combinations, indicating stringent chemical selection, and (3) different molecular species exhibited 'synchronicity of molecular populations', meaning their concentrations rose and fell in coordinated ways. These findings suggest that even simple environmental fluctuations could drive a non-chaotic progression towards molecular complexity.</p>
<p>Their findings challenge the idea of a purely chaotic prebiotic environment. Instead, they observed that their chemical systems underwent continuous change without reaching equilibrium, demonstrating combinatorial compression with stringent chemical selection and a surprising synchronicity of molecular populations. The authors propose that simple environmental oscillations could have acted as a powerful engine for the generation of increasingly complex chemical species, the very building blocks of life.</p>

<h1 id="simulation-project-what-if-eye">Simulation Project: "What if Eye?"</h1>
<p><em>Summary by Claus</em></p>
<p>The MIT Media Lab, Camera Culture group, has recently published a project called <a href="https://eyes.mit.edu/">"What if Eye?"</a>. This project aims to computationally simulate the evolution of visual systems, from early light sensors to fully fledged lensed eyes.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshots of the What if Eye simulator" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_021/whatifeye.png" /></p>
<p>The simulation occurs in virtual creatures who have to solve tasks in a 2D environment using visual input. Evolution controls both the physical characteristics of these eyes (number of eyes, lensing, etc), as well as the neural network that reads and processes the signals produced by them. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1 of the &quot;What If Eye&quot; Paper" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_021/WIE_paper.png" /></p>
<p>The project's webpage has links to both the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15001">paper describing the simulation and evolutionary framework</a>, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/cambrian-org/ACI">link to the simulation software on github</a>. </p>
<h1 id="blog-post-review-relational-biology-i-is-it-possible-to-simulate-life-complexity-cat">Blog Post Review: "Relational Biology I: Is it possible to simulate life? - Complexity Cat"</h1>
<p>Summary by Imy</p>
<p>What's the real difference between a biological model and a simulation, and why is this distinction crucial for understanding life?</p>
<p>Complexity Cat recently started <a href="https://amahury.github.io/posts/trilogy-relational-biology-I/">a new blog series</a> exploring the field of relational biology, pioneered by Robert Rosen. Moving beyond a purely reductionist view of life's molecular components, relational biology emphasises the organisational relationships and interactions that define living systems. This first post introduces these ideas to readers, and directly tackles a common misinterpretation that Rosen outright denied the possibility of simulating life.</p>
<p>Instead, the blog post argues that Rosen's work (alongside that of his mentor, Nicolas Rashevsky) suggests that traditional, algorithmic simulations may inherently struggle to capture the essence of living systems, particularly their closure to efficient causation i.e. the ability of a system's components to generate and maintain their own organisation. The blog post clarifies the Rosen's distinction between abstract models and computational simulations and discusses how relational approaches offer a different lens for understanding the fundamental principles of life. </p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://amahury.github.io/posts/trilogy-relational-biology-I/">full blog post</a> over on Complexity Cat.</p>
<p>As an aside, <a href="https://amahury.github.io/">Complexity Cat</a> is an excellent and frequently updated resource for those interested in ALife. It is managed by <a href="https://twitter.com/amahury0">Amahury J. L. Díaz</a> and colleagues, so feel free to explore and follow their blog.</p>

<p>In this edition we have collected quite a few interesting videos, here they all are for your viewing pleasure!</p>
<p>"The Physics of Living Systems" with Chris Kempes for "Reason with Science" 
<img alt="" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_021/kempes.png" /></p>
<p>"This episode is with Chris Kempes, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, working at the fascinating intersection of physics and biology. Chris joins us to talk about some of the most profound questions about life starting from fundamental definitions to exploring life's potential multiple origins guided by the laws of physics. Join us as we explore the role of energy landscapes in Prebiotic chemistry, the physical basis of microbial behaviors, scaling laws that govern life's metabolic patterns, and how collective behaviors emerge in multicellular organisms. Let's embark on a journey to rethink life's mysteries through the lens of physics."</p>

<p>“Robots and Artificial Life from Visual Foundation Models”, a talk by Phillip Isola (MIT) for Spring 2025 GRASP on Robotics.
<img alt="" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_021/isola.png" /></p>
<p>ABSTRACT
"I will talk about two ways we can design agents with the help of powerful vision/graphics models. In the first project, LucidSim, we augment a traditional robotics simulation engine (MuJoCo) with visual detail from an image generative model. The generator adds diversity and realism to the barebones MuJoCo content, and results in a RGB-only policy trained entirely in sim that generalizes zero-shot to the real world. In the second project, ASAL, we use a visual recognition model to search for artificial lifeforms that display distinct and interesting behaviors. This process can discover cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway’s Game of Life, particle swarms that flock like Boids, and more."</p>

<p>"All cells have the same genome, but each cell must perform tasks according to its position in the growing organism.
To do this, cells must somehow interact with each other and regulate the expression of their genes.
This project is dedicated to exploring this process.
I'm not a biologist. While delving into this topic,
I'm trying to model these processes on a computer and create videos based on the results of my experiments."</p>
