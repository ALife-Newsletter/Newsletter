<h1>Breve</h1>

<p>By Imy</p>

<p>One of my first real interactions with ALife was using 
<a href="http://www.spiderland.org/s/">Breve</a> during my MSc studies, in a class taught by <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/cnehaniv">Chrystopher Nehaniv</a> (one of the ALIFE 2026 organisers). Released in 2002, Breve is a 3D simulation environment built for "simulating decentralised systems and artificial life", ranging from flocking behaviours, evolutionary robotics, particle systems, chemical systems, swarm robotics, and much more (I actually used it for a project on diffusion-limited aggregation at the time, which was a completely new idea to me...but I thought it was pretty cool!)
</p>
<p>In writing this short contribution, I decided to download it again for a bit of nostalgia, and to remind myself of its features. What’s impressive is how it’s stood the test of time - even now, it feels like an incredibly useful piece of software, and writing this has actually made me want to go back and see if I can get my old simulations running again. Many newer members of our community might not be aware of Breve (it is from 2002, after all...maybe even before some of us were born...!), but I’d encourage you to check out the <a href="http://alife8.alife.org/proceedings/sub3945.pdf">original paper</a>, download it (sadly, the website is no longer maintained, but a quick search will help you find relevant links) and play around with the demos at least.

<p>Funnily enough, the creator of Breve, Jon Klein, was affiliated with the same university where I later became a postdoc. Small world!
