<p>by Imy</p>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game">Spore</a>) is a PC game (from 2008) that attempts to simulate the entire arc of life: starting as a microscopic organism in a tide pool and &quot;evolving&quot; through social tribes, cities, and eventually interstellar travel. I remember buying Spore on a whim from a game store when I was a teenager. At the time, I had absolutely no idea what &quot;Artificial Life&quot; even was - I just enjoyed playing video games and I was captivated by the cover artwork. After taking it home and installing it, I played it for a few weeks, but never really got into it. Or, maybe I just didn&#39;t really appreciate it. Maybe 2008-Imy wasn&#39;t ready for it. In hindsight, I realise that I had been sitting on a massive ALife sandbox!</p>
<p>My memories of the game are a bit fragmented, but I do remember watching my creatures mutate and evolve into strange entities, and all the while thinking, &quot;how does the game do that?!&quot; So maybe I should give this game another chance. A quick Google tells me it&#39;s on the Steam store, so I know what I&#39;m doing over Christmas...!</p>
