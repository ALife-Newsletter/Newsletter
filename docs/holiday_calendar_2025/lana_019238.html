<p>Ah, complexity explorables. Accessible, interactive content about complex systems.
I chose this particular one because it reminds me that no matter how different the landscape, and especially the trees and grass look between where I currently live and where I was raised, they&#39;re really just variations on a theme. At this page, you can see how changing a fairly limited set of parameters give you all kinds of plant profiles.</p>
