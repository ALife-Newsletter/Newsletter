<em>Open-endedness was just the beginning for me</em>

<p>In my first year studying computer science, it seemed like everyone else already knew how they wanted to specialize: lots of people wanted to become game developers, a few were really into cryptography, and I had no idea. Everything was interesting to me.</p>

<p>So when it came time to design my senior thesis, one cool idea stuck out from our lab meetings: open-ended evolution. I didn’t fully understand the concept, but I liked the general idea of limits and limitlessness. My professor suggested I read this paper, so I printed off a copy, put it on my kitchen table, and started working my way through it during meals.</p>

<p>By the time I got to page three, though, I just kept reading and couldn’t stop. I read all the way to the end that day, and then I read it again. It was just so good. I’m sure it didn’t hurt that the illustrations of Chromaria were both beautiful and cute, but I think that the clarity of the ideas is what really captured my attention. I was like - wow, this might be impossible, but I also totally get it.</p>

<p>I loved that, and it became the seed for my first research project.</p>
