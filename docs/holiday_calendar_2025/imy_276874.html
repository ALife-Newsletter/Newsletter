<p>By Imy</p>
<p><a href="https://jasss.org/JASSS.html">JASSS</a> is an &quot;interdisciplinary journal dedicated to the exploration of social processes through computer simulation&quot;. It was a staple during my PhD studies, where I would spend hours just reading through articles that sounded cool (remember those days when you had hours to actually peruse journal articles at your leisure?), and one that I think people may benefit from having on their radar, if they don&#39;t already.</p>
<p>I really like JASSS for being fully open access and leveraging a &quot;web-first&quot; approach to publishing articles - it makes papers feel like part of the living internet rather than static PDFs. Most importantly, JASSS strongly encourages authors to make their models public and include comprehensive documentation, which is obviously great for reproducibility. Seeing a journal prioritise the actual code as much as the article write-up is really refreshing, and I wish more journals took it as seriously as JASSS do.</p>
