<em>I've been thinking this memoir is really good</em>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed every moment reading <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393868050">this book</a>. And it wasn’t just tracing the origin of Dennett’s ideas, but the way in which he brought everything to life. It really felt as if I was right by his side, Ghost-of-Christmas-Past style, as he studied with Ryle and Quine, mastered the Rubik’s Cube with Hofstadter, and hung out with all kinds of greats. Famous people just kept showing up for dinner. The scenes of early days at the MIT AI Lab, the Santa Fe Institute, and all the other places he was somehow involved with were super fascinating too, and so vividly portrayed that each episode now feels more like a real memory than something from a book. Who could forget using stuffed turtles to test out a live-action version of the Logo programming language with real children?</p>

<p>I read this book, during what were (coincidentally) the last days of Dennett’s life, because I wanted to know more about his origin story. Instead, I was continually struck by the scope and connectedness of his life.</p>
