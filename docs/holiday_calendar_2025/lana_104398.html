<p>Remember when text generators were tiny neural nets that you&#39;d train on your own little datasets to see what happens? I do! That&#39;s probably when I had the most fun with anything AI related, and so it reminds me of simpler times... At the time, I trained one on my Twitter archive and gave it its own Twitter account. A bumbling, incoherent distillation of my Twitter personality. I also trained one on the New York Library&#39;s open archive of cruise menus and made it generate unholy dishes... which is probably why I loved this post by Janelle Shane:</p>
