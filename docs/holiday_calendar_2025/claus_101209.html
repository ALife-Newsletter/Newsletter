<h1>Learning and Coevolving Robots in Competitive Multi-Agent Environments</h1>

<img src="images/codesign_paper.png">

<p>This was one of my favorite papers from ALIFE 2025. I have always been fond of software robots simulations and, for all its problems, the evogym package is probably one of the cutest and easiest to use out there. In this paper, they prepare competitive scenarios where two robots have to evolve to defeat each other in tasks such as pushing and pulling objects, and walking past each other. The paper is easy to read, and the experiment design is quite creative.</p>
