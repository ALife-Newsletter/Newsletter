<h1 id="alife-art-project-alien">Alife Art: Project ALIEN</h1>
<p><em>Contributed by Christian Heinemann</em></p>
<p><a href="https://alien-project.org">ALIEN</a> is an open-source artificial life project which aims to bring together particle-based simulations for soft bodies with a programming model for distributed systems. In this context, agents are networks of connected particles, where the nodes possess capabilities that could be attributed to robotic or biological components: sensors, muscles, computational units and much more. The communication inside a particle network is performed by signals consisting of stateful and transient entities. They facilitate more complex behavior patterns such as food seeking, self-replication, controlled movements, attacking and digestion of resources, swarming behavior, etc. to be implemented in the networks. The simulator comes along with various examples ranging from pure mechanical to evolution simulations to play with. Own particle machines can be constructed with the built-in graph editing and programming environment. For instance, a self-replicating machine provided with enough resources could work as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="Self Replication" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/alien_selfreplication.png" /></p>
<p>From left to right: a possible replication cycle of a particle machine The replication process for this machine takes place in such a way that, starting from a center node, its own network structure is scanned and reconstructed in a spiral sequence. By injecting such a machine equipped with a functioning metabolism into a pristine world exposed to mutations, evolution simulations can be conducted. If desired, the user of the program can merely act as an observer and adjust some simulation parameters from time to time.</p>
<p><img alt="User Interface" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/alien_ui.png" /></p>
<p>The color of a particle has become more importance in recent updates. There are several color flavors available, and they can play a crucial role in the sensoring and digesting functions depending on the simulation setting. In this long-term diagram taken from the built-in simulation monitor, for instance, one can see how populations of replicators with different colors have gained the predominance at different time epochs.</p>
<p><img alt="Statistics" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/alien_statistics.png" /></p>
<p>An objective of this project is to encourage experimentation with worlds full of wonders that keep surprising the observers. ALIEN is powered by an own physics and rendering engine written in CUDA and thus requires an Nvidia graphics card.</p>

<p>While I was a graduate student, I had a bit of fun one weekend and made a touch screen simulation to play with fitness landscapes. @RELenski, @CharlesOfria, and I wrote about this tool back in 2012. <a href="https://zeeelab.github.io/FingerpaintingFitnessLandscapes.js/">Now a version lives online</a>!</p>
<p><img alt="Fingerpainting Opening" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/fingerpaint_00.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can watch a population evolve in your browser! Here, we're watching the population neutrally move around the fitness landscape. Note how correlations in the fitness landscape emerge from coalescing lineages.</p>
<p><img alt="Random Walk Animation" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/fingerpaint_01.gif" /></p>
<p>By painting in the canvas, you can create regions of higher fitness and watch as the population climbs new peaks.</p>
<p><img alt="Fingerpainting Animation" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/fingerpaint_02.gif" /></p>
<p>You can "poke" the population by erasing regions of high fitness, and watch as individuals seemingly scurry to find high fitness regions!</p>
<p><img alt="Poking the Population" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/fingerpaint_03.gif" /></p>
<p>We can see what happens if fitness is density dependent, where organisms depress the fitness landscape locally. This is depicted (and mechanistically implemented) by lightening the fitness landscape around each individual.</p>
<p><img alt="Density Fitness" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/fingerpaint_04.gif" /></p>
<p>Sexual recombination is a great way to increase variation, but it can also collapse diversity where hybrid organisms "fall off" high fitness regions. We can see that directly in cute fitness landscapes!</p>
<p><img alt="Sexual Reproduction" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/fingerpaint_05.gif" /></p>
<p>And one of my favorite fitness landscape phenomenon, survival of the flattest at high mutation rates, is easy to recreate! We can see the population favor the large but less fit region as we crank up the mutation rate.</p>
<p><img alt="Survival of the Flattest" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/fingerpaint_06.gif" /></p>
<p>I hope to keep adding to this (e.g., coevolution!), but please let me know if you have ideas. I'm certainly planning a few lessons in my classes using this, but would love to hear if others are interested!</p>
<p>(Addendum: <a href="https://zeeelab.github.io/FingerpaintingFitnessLandscapes.js/coevolution.html">Co-evolution has been added!</a>)</p>
<h1 id="project-highlight-mfmrocks">Project Highlight: MFM.rocks</h1>
<p><em>Contributed by <a href="https://twitter.com/walpolea">Andrew Walpole</a></em></p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with Dave Ackley's Movable Feast Machine (MFM), it's a radically different architecture; an entirely new computational stack of hardware and software. An indefinitely-scalable, non-deterministic, tiled grid system meant to free itself from the fragility and constraints of a centralized computational model. (You can learn more about Dr. Ackley's system via <a href="https://t2tile.com/">the T2 Tile Project</a>, where over the last 3+ years he has video-documented his journey of building a hardware-based indefinitely scalable MFM grid.)</p>
<p><a href="https://mfm.rocks">Mfm.rocks</a> is my playground of sorts; an exploratorium for this uncharted computational model. Not quite having the confidence or know-how to dive into Dr. Ackley’s platform directly, the underlying mfm-js library was born out of an insatiable yearn to explore MFM concepts first-hand. And recently I’ve completely rewritten the <a href="https://github.com/walpolea/mfm-js">library (mfm-js 2.0)</a> to be substantially more performant, allowing for bigger grids and more play!</p>
<p>Most notably, the bug that really bit me was the idea that in a robust-first environment, we will need to lean into living-systems concepts – regeneration, organic growth, reproduction, systems-thinking – in order to build software that can resiliently compute within a hostile digital environment. And while I can’t say there is too much useful computing going on as of yet, exploring lower-level living-systems concepts is unlocking ideas. Here are a few of those elemental explorations.</p>
<p><strong>Directionals</strong></p>
<p>Directionals are the name I’ve given to grid travelers that use a sense of understanding directional heading, allowing for the ability to turn left or right or reverse on the grid. Here are a few: Fly, Mosquito, Bird and Wanderer.</p>
<p><img alt="Directionals" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/mfm_directionals.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://mfm.rocks/?size=128,64&amp;speed=1&amp;selected=FLY&amp;atoms=FLY-15x11-15x46-38x33,MOSQUITO-58x15-58x56-70x31-71x53-85x17,BIRD-99x23-120x11,WANDERER-113x51-113x52-113x53-114x51-114x52-114x53-115x51-115x52-115x53">VIEW DIRECTIONAL DEMO</a></p>
<p><strong>Directors</strong></p>
<p>Directors, which can influence the heading of any Directional show how we might create spatial structures that lead a computational workflow.</p>
<p><img alt="Directors" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/mfm_directors.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://mfm.rocks/?size=128,64&amp;speed=1&amp;selected=WANDERER&amp;atoms=DIRECTOR%20S-40x21-40x23-40x27-40x29-40x33-41x18-42x16-44x15,DIRECTOR%20E-41x35-42x37-44x39-46x39-47x39-50x39-54x39-57x39-61x39-65x39,WANDERER-43x23-44x18-44x30-46x35-52x37-53x16-59x38-60x16-66x37-68x17-69x26-69x34,DIRECTOR%20W-49x14-52x14-56x14-60x14-64x14-67x14-69x15-71x16-71x19,DIRECTOR%20N-68x39-70x37-71x22-71x25-71x29-71x32-71x35">VIEW DIRECTOR DEMO</a></p>
<p><strong>Looper</strong></p>
<p>Looper is really a culmination of both concepts, a Directional itself, it loops around leaving a trail of goop and Directors that traps any unsuspecting nearby Directional.</p>
<p><img alt="Looper" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/mfm_looper.png" /></p>

<p><strong>OfSwamp</strong></p>
<p>OfSwamp has a Cell-like composure, but it came aobut as an exploration of Environments and Systems. Swampling will loop around and set up a Swamp environment where all OfSwamp types can freely traverse within, while non-swampkind have a much tougher time intruding. I had approached cell building in the past, but through the lens of an environment the concepts used to put this together ended up being very different.</p>
<p><img alt="OfSwamp" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/mfm_ofswamp.png" /></p>

<p><strong>ForkBomb</strong></p>
<p>ForkBomb is sort of the infinite loop of the MFM grid, unabashedly consuming everything in its endless wake.</p>
<p><img alt="ForkBomb" src="https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/images_edition_005/mfm_forkbomb.png" /></p>

<p><strong>AntiForkBomb and Sentry</strong></p>
<p>But Sentry, who spits out AntiForkBomb, can easily put a stop to this menace.</p>

<p><strong>Living Wall</strong></p>
<p>While some structures that are less robust easily get wiped out by ForkBomb, a Living Wall structure knows how to heal itself a bit as long as there are a few Sentry to keep it from getting entirely overridden.</p>

<p>It’s only been a few months of working with mfm-js 2.0 and I’m only just getting started with this new set of living-systems experiments. I would like to explore more around regeneration, and building computational systems using specialized structures and elemental environments on the grid. There are also more elements and demos available over on the 1.0 version (most notably, SwapWorm and CellBrane) which is still available to check out at https://mfm.rocks/v1/ as well as the game, Dungeon Grid, I built on top of the mfm-js library https://mfm.rocks/v1/game/. The project is open source and I welcome anyone interested in building elements to jump in.

<h1 id="competition-highlight-evocraft">Competition Highlight: Evocraft</h1>
<p><em>Contributed by <a href="https://twitter.com/enasmel">Elias Najarro</a></em></p>
<p>The purpose of this contest on open-endedness is to highlight the progress in algorithms that can create novel and increasingly complex artefacts. While most experiments in open-ended evolution have so far focused on simple toy domains, we believe Minecraft -with its almost unlimited possibilities- is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04751">perfect environment</a> to study and compare such approaches. While other popular Minecraft competitions, like MineRL, have an agent-centric focus, in this competition the goal is to directly evolve Minecraft builds.</p>
<p>To facilitate the development of submissions, we provide the <a href="https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py">EvoCraft API</a>: a python interface to Minecraft. EvoCraft is implemented as a mod for Minecraft that allows clients to manipulate blocks in a running Minecraft server programmatically through an API. The framework is specifically developed to facilitate experiments in artificial evolution. The competition framework also supports the recently added "redstone" circuit components in Minecraft, which allowed players to build amazing functional structures, such as bridge builders, battle robots, or even complete CPUs. Can an open-ended algorithm running in Minecraft discover similarly complex artefacts automatically? If you have an API feature that you would like to use that is currently missing, feel free to open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
