# Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life - Now on Discord!
By [Imy Khan](https://twitter.com/Imy_TK) on behalf of the ERA Board.

The Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life (ERA) group is transitioning over to Discord as the main platform of communications. The community is growing (again), and we would love to have you there. Since it's inception, the intention for the ERA group has been to create a space for (self-identifying) emerging (early) researchers in the ALife community to make connections, have discussions, and generally find ways to connect and have fun. 

The ERA group is also running informal seminars and hang outs every few weeks on Discord, where you can also learn a little bit more about the group and its current members.

Please join the Discord using the link [here](https://discord.gg/fvJkKCKy4C). See you inside.
