# The ALife community in Scientific American
Shared by [Lana](https://mstdn.science/home)

Scientific American published an article on Artificial Life, and interviewed many familiar names about where they think the field is going.
This piece was more than one year in the works, and is a good intro to our field if your relatives keep asking you "what do you work on again?" and you're struggling to provide a family-friendly answer!
I don't personally agree with 100% of the opinions in the article, but I think it's really well done and I enjoyed reading it!
