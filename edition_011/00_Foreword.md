# A word from the team

Welcome to the 11th issue of the Alife Newsletter!

The theme for this issue is **creatures**, virtual creatures, real
creatures, fictional creatures. If it moves, we got it here!

Some of the amazing contributions to this edition include: a link to a
paper about an interface for people to play games with algae; a web
game that allows you to design a virtual creature with bones, muscle
tissue and brain controls; a review of a paper laying the basic ideas
of modelling life; and many other interesting tidbits!

Talking about creatures, we would like to welcome [Gabriel
Severino](https://twitter.com/GJSeverino), who has joined the team
with an amazing contribution: the banner that you see on top of this
edition!

If you'd like to contribute in any way to the newsletter: talking
about your project, boosting something that you like, or even just
