# Book Review: "The Mountain"
By [Kai Olav Ellefsen](https://twitter.com/Jallafsen)

"Mountain" is a short story from 2012 by Liu Cixin, author of The
Three-Body Problem. It is available in the Apex Magazine or in
the short story collection "The Wandering Earth".

Mountain tells the story of an alien ship appearing on Earth, and the
aliens describing how they developed into a space faring
civilization. From an ALIFE-perspective, this story is fascinating, as
it asks the question of how a civilization would develop if it started
out with conditions that are very different to those faced by life on
earth.

The aliens describe their species originating in a space they call the
"Bubble World": A spherical space without gravity around 3,500 miles
in diameter, surrounded by a solid wall of rock in all
directions. Similar to human explorers throughout the ages, the aliens
after a while developed a drive to discover what existed beyond the
walls of their bubble world and began developing technology for
tunneling through the rock wall. "Mountain" goes on to describe in
fascinating detail how this alien species went on to form theories
about the universe they found themselves in, allowing them to find
their way out of the "Bubble world" and eventually even begin to
explore other planets.

The details of the aliens' journey are best experienced in the short
story. From an ALIFE perspective, I found it fascinating to see this
very detailed description of how a civilization could develop
technology, form theories about their surroundings and explore their
universe in an environment so different from the one our civilization
has developed in. For instance, the story describes the iterative
development of scientific theory through generations of the aliens'
lifetimes: Initially, the aliens believed their world was one of
potentially several hollow bubbles in an otherwise solid
universe. They called this cosmology the Solid Universe
Theory. However, after thousands of years of exploring deep into the
walls of their bubble, the aliens make a surprising discovery: The
density of the walls decreased in all directions - indicating there
may be an outer edge beyond which their universe is no longer
solid. Obviously, this discovery shook the alien society, leading some
(the Solid Universe purists) to dismiss it with alternative
explanations, while others saw it as a beginning of a new scientific
theory of their universe.

Liu Cixin has done a very impressive job carefully thinking of the
details of how an alien society would work in these strange
environmental conditions, and by describing these details he forces
the reader to reflect on our own planet, and our own theories of
physics and cosmology.
