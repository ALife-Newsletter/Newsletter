# Playing Video Games on Algae
Shared by [Lana](mstdn.science/@lana)

In this 2019 paper, researchers created a JavaScript web toolkit to allow real-time interaction with swarms of the algae Euglena, used as "active matter".
Beginner and expert users were then able to program little video games where the human gamer interacts with the algae through joysticks or leds.
Sadly [the code](https://github.com/hirklab/euglenalab) seems to have gone stale since the paper was published, but have a look at the game descriptions and this video of the interface.

![Figure from the paper showing screen captures of the different games created by users. Caption: Study participants (studies S1b and S1c) were enabled to create a variety of interactive biological applications (A–D, Top is screenshot and A–D, Bottom is illustrative picture of program). (A) (novice user, study S1b) A video game where the player must get specific Euglena into a moving virtual green box, controlled by the player, while the user-directed LEDs shine in the direction of the moving box, making the Euglena move away from the target goal. (B) (expert user, study S1c) A continuously rotating line visualizing the average orientation of all organisms detected by the BPU. (C) (expert user, study S1c) A two-player game where the first player shoots the red ball from a particular position with the aim of hitting as many Euglena as possible, while the second player then tries to steer the Euglena with the arrow keys (mapped to LEDs) so that the ball avoids as many Euglena as possible. (D) (semiexpert user) A histogram of Euglena rotations on the screen, grouped into bucket sizes of 10°. This program allows the user to change the intensity of the four LEDs by dragging four sliders on the screen. This program was created by an undergraduate who did not participate in any study and who later joined the research team. Mouse click event listeners were not explicitly supported by the current version of Bioty but were added through native JavaScript mouse event handlers on the HTML5 canvas.](images/euglena-game.png?h=100)
