**Crescent Loom** is a game about weaving new forms of life. Players build up an intuitive sense of central pattern generators by knitting bones, stitching muscles, and linking neurons to design an underwater creature in a biologically-realistic neuronbiology simulation. After using these Lego-like biological tools to make a creature, it is then put to the challenge of exploring environments, navigating past hazards, and competing against each other in races ‚Äî all with constant access to view and modify their simulated nervous system in real time.

By wrapping a detailed RC-circuit model in a friendly user interface, it is designed to be the most accessible entryway into previously-gated high-level neuroscience concepts like reciprocal inhibition, postinhibitory rebound, reversal potentials, and channel-based intrinsic membrane properties. Over 5000 creatures have been made and uploaded to the public pool.

There is also a virtual wetlab "Connectome Explorer" which provides mock lab tools to puzzle out obscured connectomes of creatures created in the game's editor. Students can collect data to map unknown nervous systems using ablation, optogenetics, current clamping, and pharmacological blockers of excitation, inhibition, and action potentials.
