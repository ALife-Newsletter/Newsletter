**Artificial Life Newsletter 009 -- [micro] organisms | cosms | scale**

# A word from the team

Happy 2023, and welcome to the 9th issue of the Alife Newsletter!

For the first edition of 2023, we have some technical news: The newsletter now has an RSS feed! If you have an RSS reader, you can point it to [this link](https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/RSS.xml) to receive announcements of new editions of the newsletter. Give it a try!

The theme for this edition is "[micro] organisms | cosms | scale". For micro-organisms, we report on a novel idea for an wearable device that integrates living mold with electronics. For micro-cosms, we link a review of small programs that can generate complex worlds. And for micro-scale, we found a delightful art imagining the origins of life.

In adition, we have a paper review about life as information, and the syllabus of a new artificial life course, as well as CFP deadlines and announcements of PhD positions! We hope you find something that pique your interest.

As usual, we welcome contributions, ideas and suggestions to the newsletter at [this form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9)! In particular, we are specially interested in Master and PhD students who want to talk about their own research ideas. Do send us a line!
