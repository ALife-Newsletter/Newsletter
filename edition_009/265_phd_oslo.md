# Hiring PhD Candidate in Biologically Inspired methods for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oslo
by Kai Olav Ellefsen, University of Oslo

The PhD research fellow will carry out research on AI and machine learning techniques (including search / optimization) for robotic systems, at the group of Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ROBIN). We wish to build on our previous and ongoing projects in Evolutionary Robotics with the aim of developing new methods for more robust and flexible robotic adaptation. This could include combining Evolutionary Robotics with recent advances from Deep Learning or more biologically inspired methods, such as Neuroevolution.

Qualifications: Applicants must have education equivalent to a Norwegian masters degree in computer science, robotics, or other relevant field. Thus, applicants should have a strong background in programming, as well as machine learning/artificial intelligence and robotics. Experience with Evolutionary Algorithms, Evolutionary Robotics, Quality Diversity optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and/or Neuroevolution are considered advantageous.

Pay grade (depending on qualifications and seniority):
NOK 501 200 – 544 400 per year, approx.: € or $ 48,150 – 52,350
