# Bringing Physics to Life, an Ideas Lab from the Templeton Foundation
*by Lana Sinapayen*

This event held in Czech Republic brought together early career scientists from 3 big fields: Artificial Life, Biological Chemistry, and Nonequilibrium Physics.
It was an intense workshop where we had one week to write several grants to apply for up to $5 million in total funding to tackle a research question related to Origins of Life research. Thankfully, the event was highly structured along a tried and tested schedule that saw us generate dozen of ideas individually or in teams, and gradually select the most promising to develop them through several cycles of writing and presentation. 
Without giving away any details, the topics broadly ranged from planetary science to information theory, alternatives to the RNA-world hypothesis, and new definitions of life.
It was exhausting but rewarding. I left having expanded my network of colleagues through true collaborative work rather than simple conference-style chitchat, and with many new ideas to advance my own research. 
The organization was top notch, the discussions between different fields both difficult and enriching. I would highly encourage anyone to apply to relevant "Ideas Lab" if they have a chance.
