# A word from the team

Welcome to the 6th issue of the ALife Newsletter. Summer is here in the North hemisphere and we are all being boiled alive, but hopefully this fresh newsletter will help cooling you down!

This edition has several paper reviews, a course review, and two workshop summaries! If you attended an ALife event recently, let us know.

The Newsletter is distributed by email, and archived on the International Society for Artificial Life's website.
