Picture the space of all possible forms of intelligence. Now zoom in — way in — until you see a tiny mote. That’s where we’re stuck right now: trapped in the speck of machine learning and large language models.

While these tools are impressive, they represent just a fraction of this possibility space. AI discourse risks becoming a closed loop, with concerns about ML’s impact met only with proposals for better ML models, reinforcing our fixation. How do we build outward to see and benefit from intelligence in all its wonderfully diverse embodiments?
