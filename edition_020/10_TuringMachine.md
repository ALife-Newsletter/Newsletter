shared by XXXX

**webpage here: https://samwho.dev/turing-machines/**

**What is this webpage about? (easy to read introduction to the concept of turing machine, computability, and turing completeness)**

**Why is this page interesting to alifers? (We build our simulations on computers, what are they based on? // Could life exist in an environment bound by computability? // Definitions of life and computability // etc -- note, keep it brief)**

**About the author of the webpage, and if there is other cool stuff there -- it is kinda cool that he developed this webpage in online streams -- the importance of educating the basics clearly**
