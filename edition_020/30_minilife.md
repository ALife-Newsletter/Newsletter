# €13mn ‘MiniLife’ project aims to create artificial life from scratch
Written by [Imy](http://imytk.github.io)

Can we create life de novo? 

This remains one of the grand aims of the artificial life community, both for the study of life-as-it-is, and also for life-as-it-could-be (Christopher Langton mentioned in his 1989 essay that, "One way to pursue the study of artificial life [is] to attempt to create life in vitro.)

But this is not an easy task, as anyone involved in artificial life will tell you. Since we're still in disagreement about what the minimal conditions would be to call a system "living", and perhaps even less clear on how we would identify that these conditions have been met, it is perhaps no surprise that we don't see many (funded) long-term projects that are driven by the idea of trying to create life from scratch.

Recently, the MiniLife project, led by evolutionary biologist Professor Eörs Szathmary of the [Parmenides Foundation](https://www.parmenides-foundation.org/news/parmenides-foundation-wins-erc-synergy-grant) along with 3 other PIs, received a 13 million Euro grant by the European Research Council (ERC) to do just that. The six-year project consists of a team of biologists and chemists across a number of universities with the aim of producing metabolically active cells that grow, divide, and evolve within a chemical system.

''Our approach to creating the first artificial chemical living system takes the following steps: (1) Identification of new, and development of existing, autocatalytic (super)systems that function as chemical (and informational) replicators. (2) Coupling of metabolism with chemical replicators. (3) Coupling of autocatalysis to compartment growth and division. (4) Synthesis of a chemical supersystem comprising all three components (replication, metabolism and compartmentalisation). (5) Demonstrating minimal Darwinian evolution upon subjecting the systems synthesized in 1-3 to out-of-equilibrium selection regimes. (6) Approaching a minimal living system by enhancing of the evolvability of the triple systems developed in 4.''

Though many of the news articles of this project are behind paywalls, you can read more details about the project [on the Parmenides Foundation website](https://www.parmenides-foundation.org/news/parmenides-foundation-wins-erc-synergy-grant).
