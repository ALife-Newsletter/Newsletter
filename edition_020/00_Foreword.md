# A Word from the Team

Welcome to the 20th issue of the ALife Newsletter! 

[Never miss an issue by subscribing here](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89).

In this edition, we learn about a 13 million Euro push to create a minimal living system, explore a cool interactive website all about Turing machines, and envision systems to light up the space of infinite possible intelligences.

A review of the literature reveals bacteria trained to perform computations, a snapshot of ALife-as-it-was over 20 years ago, and a new class of life that has been colonizing us all along.

In the land of opportunity, the University of Oslo is hiring a postdoc focusing on bio-inspired AI, the Tölvera Python library is accepting applications for Google Summer of Code 2025, and we have a roundup of conferences with active calls. Plus, Jitka Čejková is preparing a book to commemorate 40 years of ALife conferences, to be filled with *your* stories and memories!

Last, but not least, we are glad to welcome a new member to the ALife Newsletter team: a warm welcome to Martha Emerson!

If you have any suggestions for future content, or would like to help us edit the newsletter, you can leave us a message in the [contribution form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9). We specially appreciate messages from Master and PhD students who want to talk about their recent work. Send us a line! If you got something to share that other ALifers would be interested in, we want to know about it!

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus, Gabriel and Martha
