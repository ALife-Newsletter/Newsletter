# TÃ¶lvera at Google Summer of Code 2025

Shared by Jack Armitage, TÃ¶lvera

TÃ¶lvera has been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2025, as a sub-organisation under the Python Software Foundation! ðŸŽ‰

TÃ¶lvera is a Python library designed for composing together and interacting with basal agencies, inspired by fields such as artificial life (ALife) and self-organising systems. It provides creative coding-style APIs that allow users to combine and compose various built-in behaviours, such as flocking, slime mold growth, and swarming, and also author their own.

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers new contributors over 18 an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.

To find out more and learn how to apply, [read TÃ¶lvera's GSoC page](https://afhverjuekki.github.io/tolvera/gsoc).

Discussion will take place on the TÃ¶lvera Discord's #gsoc channel
