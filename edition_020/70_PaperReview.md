# Paper Review - Collective Intelligence of the Artificial Life Community on Its Own Successes, Failures, and Future (Rasmussen et al., 2003)
Written by [Imy](http://imytk.github.io)

In a departure from typical ALife research, this paper offers a refreshing introspective view of our field and community, and so I really wanted to bring it to people's attention. Rasmussen et al.'s 2003 study, ['Collective Intelligence of the Artificial Life Community on Its Own Successes, Failures, and Future,'](https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/9/2/207/2428/Collective-Intelligence-of-the-Artificial-Life) presents a rare qualitative survey of ALife practitioners (specifically, some of the attendees at the Artificial Life VII conference), offering a snapshot of the community's self-perception at the time. Perhaps some of you reading this even remember filling in this survey!

Attendees of the Artificial Life VII conference were asked to complete a web-based survey, seeking to collect their opinions on the successes and failures of ALife as a scientific discipline, as well as the organisation of the wider ALife community. Respondents cited the advancement of bottom-up modeling, sharpening the definition of life, and helping to better understand evolution as some of the main accomplishments of the field, but also voiced concerns regarding the field's overly-theoretical focus, methodological rigor, and lack of connection with other disciplines. 

The paper provides a nice historical glimpse into the community's perception of its own maturity and direction, and is certainly worth reading if you're curious to see how the community perceived itself in the early 2000s. Given how much progress we have seen in ALife (both as a field and a community), I (personally) think it would be interesting to replicate this study twenty years on to see how these opinions may have changed.
