# Paper Review - Collective Intelligence of the Artificial Life Community on Its Own Successes, Failures, and Future (Rasmussen et al., 2003)
Written by [Imy](http://imytk.github.io)

In a departure from typical ALife research, this paper offers a unique introspective view of the field itself. Rasmussen et al.'s 2003 study, ['Collective Intelligence of the Artificial Life Community on Its Own Successes, Failures, and Future,'](https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/9/2/207/2428/Collective-Intelligence-of-the-Artificial-Life) presents a rare qualitative survey of ALife practitioners (specifically, some of the attendees at the Artificial Life VII conference), offering a snapshot of the community's self-perception at the time.

Rasmussen's work provides a unique window into the ALife community's mindset in 2003. Respondents identified significant accomplishments, such as advancing bottom-up modeling and sharpening the definition of life, but also voiced concerns regarding the field's overly-theoretical focus, methodological rigor, and lack of connection with other disciplines. 

The paper provides a valuable glimpse into the community's perception of its own maturity and direction. Given how rapidly evolving a field and community like ALife is, I (personally) think it would be interesting to replicate this study twenty years on to see how these opinions may have changed.
