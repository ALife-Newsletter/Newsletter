The process of "aerial seeding" (or "re-seeding", or "reforestation") is, as the name suggests, a process by which seeds can be distributed (or sown) over areas of land via aerial means, by using vehicles such as helicopters or drones. These processes are advantageous in some scenarios: being able to sow seeds in hard-to-reach areas (i.e. areas of high elevation), or to (re)distribute seeds across large areas in a time-effective manner (i.e. after a natural disaster) to stop the growth of invasive species, can help maintain or improve levels of vegetation over a given land mass. However, the success of aerial seeding hinges on the seed's ability to successfully sow into the ground that it was dispersed. The morphology of natural seeds, including the payload they can carry and the types of soils they can successfully bury themselves into, have evolved to the specifical ecological niche that they have typically grown in. Therefore, the morphology of natural seed carriers (such as the Erodium seeds) may not be suited for the environmental conditions in which they would need to be distributed through aerial seeding - potentially limiting the success of this type of technique.

The authors of the paper above looked to address this problem. In it, the authors, who were inspired by the structure and dynamics of a natural seed (Erodium), designed and tested a bio-inspired self-burying seed carrier that may be able to overcome some limitations of natural seed carriers. They describe their design of a number of "three-tailed seed carriers" using wood veneer (selected for its stiff biomass), and also give a wonderful description of their experiments and computer (numerical) simulations to optimise the design of these seed carriers. They tested the efficacy of these designs in both laboratory and outdoor conditions, comparing the performance to the Erodium seed and a number of other (hygroscopic) seeds. Their results show significant success, in terms of anchoring rate and germination rate, for their seed carriers, over their natural counterparts. 

Such a short review cannot do the content or the quality of this paper true justice. Nevertheless, it is a pleasant read and an excellent showcase of ALife approaches being applied to natural world problems.
