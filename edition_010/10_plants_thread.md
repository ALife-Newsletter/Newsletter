# Solarpunk and Plants in Video Games
[Lana](mstdn.science/@lana) relaying a thread by [Eli](https://twitter.com/logicsoup)

Have you heard of [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk)? I had not. According to Wikipedia, "Solarpunk is a literary and artistic movement that envisions and works toward actualizing a sustainable future interconnected with nature and community."
I don't play much video games but that is certainly a genre I enjoy, even if I didn't know it had a name!

Last January, [Eli](https://twitter.com/logicsoup) posted a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/logicsoup/status/1619775847778619392?t=xx8P6dLCMskMpuM54W1vnA&s=19) on Solarpunk games and games focused on plant simulation.
There is a lot of overlap with ALife topics, so I encourage you to go have a look! Here are some images from the thread:
