**Artificial Life Newsletter 010 -- Plants!**

# A word from the team

Welcome to the 10th issue of the Alife Newsletter!
Congratulations to all who made it to the ALife2023 paper submission deadline, and for those who didn't, workshop deadlines are still upcoming!

This edition celebrates the coming in of the new season: spring is almost here, and, for many of us, that means lots of plants! We have tried to organise this month's newsletter around plant-related content, so we hope you enjoy this month's offering. From plants that can mimic other plants, to papers on self-burying seeds, to aesthetically-pleasing simulations of micro-organisms, this newsletter is filled to the brim with some very creative and interesting projects. You're sure to find at least one interesting thing here.

As usual, we welcome contributions, ideas and suggestions to the
newsletter at [this form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9)! In
particular, we are specially interested in Master and PhD students who
want to talk about their own research ideas. Do send us a line!

If you'd like to receive our news, you can subscribe by e-mail
[here](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89), or by RSS
[here](https://alife-newsletter.github.io/Newsletter/RSS.xml).

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Katt.
