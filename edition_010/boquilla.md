I (Lana) have been intrigued by the Peruvian vine Boquilla Trifoliolata for years, and even unsuccefully tried to import some for experiments (if you can help hit me up).
That plant is said to (maybe) be able to imitate the shape of other plants around it - unfortunately, the published research on the topic is spare and lacking control experiments.
Does it really change the shape of it leaves? Can it actually see shapes, as claimed by one very criticized paper?
SciHow recently released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UWWsYw9fH0&t) that summarizes the strange claims arount this plant.
