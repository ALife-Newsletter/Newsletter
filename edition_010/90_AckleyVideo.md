# Media Review: The T2 Tile Project Channel
By [Claus Aranha](https://scholar.social/@caranha)

What if we built a computational framework composed of independent
units that could be plugged in and out together at will and, more
amazingly, **online**?

This is the premise of the [T2 Tile project](https://t2tile.com),
developed by [Dave
Ackley](https://scholar.social/@livcomp@hachyderm.io). In his own
words:

> **The T2 Tile project is an attempt to build the world's first
> indefinitely scalable computational stack.** First, we suspend the
> idea that we must be bound to an architecture based on correct and
> efficient deterministic hardware and software. Instead, much like
> the physical world around us, we look to robustness as a
> foundational requirement, building living systems as vessels for
> digital computation that is firstly robust, then as correct as
> possible, and finally, as efficient as necessary.

Maybe you have heard of this project before, but did you know that
Dave has been doing a [Video
Blog](https://www.youtube.com/@T2TileProject) of the project on
Youtube for the past 4 years?

The videos are short (about 20 minutes), fun, and for me they have
been something to look forward to every month. Not only for learning
about the project itself, but also to think about how to do science
communication in today's media landscape. 

Here is for another year of big fun!
