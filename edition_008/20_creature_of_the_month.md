# Astrovitae's Creature of the Month - The Onyx Flutter Flea
By [Domenic V. Pennetta](https://twitter.com/domenicpennetta)

Last month I shared the speculative biology magazine Astrovitae with 
the ALife community. After many excited responses from ALife members, 
I now plan on sharing a creature from Astrvoitae Magazine every month! 
In each newsletter a speculative biology artist and their chosen 
creature design will be showcased for all to see. For this initial 
"Creature of the Month", I want to showcase the first ever creature 
featured in Astrovitae, the onyx flutter flea, which was published on the 
cover of issue 1!

From the naked eye, these small planktonic creatures appear to float using 
a "halo" or "ring". However under closer inspection this halo is in fact 
the specimen’s forearms locked in place above its head. This particular s
pecies of flutter flea has been identified within the oceans of the 
exoplanet Perdita c, and is named Anellusbrachium onyx (a.k.a. the onyx 
flutter flea). Its large forearms forming the halo are used for feeding; 
often outstretched and are able to clamp shut when another planktonic 
organism wriggles by. Once caught, prey items will become ensnared by 
sharp follicles, and are held in place long enough to be pierced by the 
onyx flutter flea’s proboscis. Like other species of flutter fleas, A. onyx 
is found in aggregates, passively waiting in the water column for 
unsuspecting victims.
