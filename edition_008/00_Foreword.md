# A word from the team

Welcome to the 8th issue of the ALife Newsletter. As 2022 is drawing to
a close, we hope that everyone is having a great fall or spring!

This month we got two very interesting projects to share: A free book
on Conway's Game of Life by Nathaniel and Dave, and an Alife 
Simulation in Pico8 by Lj. We are particularly intersted in showcasing 
smaller projects like the last one, that inspire people to prototype and 
share their own ideas of what Alife could be!

Also this month we introduce our first regular column, "Creature of the Month"
by Domenic from Astrovitae, sharing a little bit of speculative 
bio to tickle everyone's mind each edition. If you have an idea for a 
regular column, please reach out! For example, we would love to have 
someone who could review alife inspired games for the newsletter.


 Last month we had the 
yearly meeting of the [International Society of Artificial Life 
(Alife 2022)](https://www.2022.alife.org/), which we hope was as inspiring 
for everyone as it was for our team.

We are terribly grateful and humbled by receiving the **ISAL Exceptional 
Service Award**. We would like to thank everyone who has made 
contributions to these Seven Editions, and everyone who has taken the 
time to read our collection of Artificial Life news and interesting 
projects. We hope to continue serving as a platform to amplify the 
voices of our community, and raise awareness of cool and inspiring 
projects to everyone.

Speaking about cool and inspiring projects, in this edition we highlight 
some great projects, including droplets, cultural simulations, 
speculative bio art, media reviews and more! We hope you enjoy it.
The Newsletter is distributed by email, and archived on the 
International Society for Artificial Life's website.

As usual, we welcome contributions, ideas and suggestions to the newsletter at [this form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9)! 
In particular, we are specially interested in Master and PhD students who want to talk about their own research ideas. Do send us a line!
