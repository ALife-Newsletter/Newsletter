# A word from the team

Welcome to the 8th issue of the ALife Newsletter. As 2022 is drawing to
a close, we hope that everyone is having a great fall or spring!

This month we got two very interesting projects to share: A free book
on Conway's Game of Life by Nathaniel and Dave, and an Alife 
Simulation in Pico8 by Lj. We are particularly intersted in showcasing 
smaller projects like the last one, that inspire people to prototype and 
share their own ideas of what Alife could be!

Also this month we introduce our first regular column, "Creature of the Month"
by Domenic from Astrovitae, sharing a little bit of speculative 
bio to tickle everyone's mind each edition. If you have an idea for a 
regular column, please reach out! For example, we would love to have 
someone who could review alife inspired games for the newsletter.

As usual, we welcome contributions, ideas and suggestions to the newsletter 
at [this form](https://forms.gle/jv7FdtdbWVTaTFGd9)! In particular, we are 
specially interested in Master and PhD students who want to talk about their 
own research ideas. Do send us a line!

If you'd like to receive our e-mails, you can subscribe [here](https://forms.gle/QpQ68xhvSMt4wiv89).

Lana, Imy, Mitsuyoshi, Claus and Katt.
